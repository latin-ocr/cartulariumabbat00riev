still admitted of such description as that noticed a while
since in the records left by the Chroniclers of the circum-
stances of the foundation, could scarcely be looked upon
as likely to be efficient helpers where money or money's
worth was urgently needed. From the lords of the soil,
in their several degrees, and from the lords of the soil
only, could the material aid that was needed be
expected ; and, as we have noticed‚ their aid came
in slowly, and, as it were, reluctantly. If we scruti-
nise the catalogue of grants tabulated in No. CCCLXIX.
(derived from the same source as its predecessor),
we find the total amount of gifts, made and accepted
within the first fifty years or so of the Convent's being,
summed up in the number of fifty carucates.

Moreover, in this same connection, another considera-
tion is that the F oundation grant—nay, that the ulti-
mate whole of Espec's grant—is not of an overwhelming
nature. It might be possible, with a certain allowance,
to write touching the endowment of Kirkham: ‘⁵ The
bounty of the founder was dealt out with no niggard or
parsimonious hand.. . . He bestowed upon his Priory
those most magnificent gifts,'⁷ lands and tithes in Nor-
thumberland, the advowsons of seven churches, divers
considerable vills or manors in Yorkshire, so that it
might all be summed ula—“He (the founder) devoted
to the endowment of Kirkham alone a revenue esti-
mated in the earlier part of the twelfth century at the
annual sum of 1300 marks⁷' 1 But it was widely other-
wise with Rievaulx. Four carucates at Griff and five at
