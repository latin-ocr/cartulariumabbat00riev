INTRODUCTION. xci

date assigned for his death by the Melrose Chronicler '' (Hex-
ham Book, i. p. 193 n.). The entry in the Chronica stands:
“ Α0 Μο1Χν11., obiit piae memoriae Aldredus, ΙΙΙ. Abbas Rievallis‚
cui successit Silvanus, Abbas de Dundraynan.'' It is impos-
sible to overlook the distinctly precise statement that Aelred
was the third Abbot of Rieva11IX, which admitted, Waltheof's
claim to be reckoned among the Abbots quite disappears. But
over and above this, there are other considerations which I do
not think ought to be ignored‚ as bearing upon Mr. VValbran's
notion that Prior-Waltheof of Kirkham became successively
Abbot of Rievaulx and of Melrose. Mr. Walbran, as already
noted (p. xxviii w), states that Prior Waltheof was a kinsman of
the Earl of Albemarle, and that it was through his (Waltheof's)
influence that the latter founded the Religious House at
Thornton. Assuming that identification to be ascertained, the
Mailros Chronicler affords us abundant means of identisying
the Abbot of Melrose who was distinguished by the same
name. At p. 167 is the following entry :—“ Anno Mcxlvi„
Walthevus, frater Henrici, Comitis N orthimbrorum, et Simonis,
Comitis Northumpt011ae‚factus est Abbas de Mailros,’' and on
the following page “ AO Mclix. obiit piae memoriae Waldevus,
Abbas secundus de Mailros, iii non. Augusti, qui suit avun-
culus Regis M[alcohni]‚ et 11711101111110, ejusdem ecclesiae mona-
chus, ei successit.'' Dugdale, it is true, does not mention
Henry, here described as “Comes Northi1nbrorum,'' but he
names Simon, Earl of N orthampton, and VValtheof, Abbot of
Melrose, and names them as sons of Earl Simon St. Liz by
Maud, daughter of WValtheofi late Earl of Northurnbria, who,
for her second husband, had King David of Scotland. He was
succeeded on the throne of Scotland by his grandson, Mal-
colm IV„ son of Henry of Huntingdon, who was thus half—
brother of Abbot Waltheof. Hence the descriptive “ avunculus
Regis M.’' There can therefore be no reasonable doubt who
Abbot Waltheof of Melrose really was, and that 110 was an
utterly different person froin Prior Waltheof of Kirkham.

4. SYLVANUS.-After Aelred in Burton’s “Catalogue of the
Abbots of Rieval,’' as fourth Abbot is named Roger, with the
date 1175 prefixed to his name3 and as fifth, Bcrnard, with
the date 1180 affixed3 and, as authority, is quoted “Willis's
Hist. of Abbies‚ V. 2, p. 2823 Lib. Rieval. p. 833 Johnston's
Mss. v, K. i. p. 83.'' I have been so far unable to consult
either of the authorities cited, but there would seem to bc con-
siderable difficulties in the way of accepting either the Abbots
themselves, or the dates alleged as the (lates at which they
