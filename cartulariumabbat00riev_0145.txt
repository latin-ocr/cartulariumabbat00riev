vation‚ is almost certainly a phonetic
corruption of this old name. The
transiti0n‚ and especially in the
mouth of a Dales Yorkshireman‚ is
so easy and sels-suggesting from
Raudpath‚ pronounced quickly, to
Roopa, that Ι think it may be safely
assumed3 and assuming it, we have
to follow a “gata” “street ⁷* 01·
road, leading northwards from Roppa
up to a certain bifurcation, where a
deviation to the right occurs, both
the bifurcation and the deviating
road or track being entirely uncertain
and indefinite, until we turn to the
map and notice the sudden deviation,
to the right, of the existing boundary—
line, both from the vicinity of an
unquestionably old track (for it is
marked as a “bridle road,’' and is
traeeable as such for miles), and
along the general line of another
moor-road or track-way ; after which,
from the total loss or disuse of any
name at all resembling Smithsdale,
the run of the divisa is indefinite,
except in so far as the modern
boundary, which may be easily
followed in the six-inch maps, is our
ide.

gul No trace whatever seems to exist
on which to found even a surmise as
to the whereabouts of the dale thus
named; unless the fabrica called “ le
Yron Smethes’' in Ministers’ Ac—
counts (printed towards the end of
the present volume) be held to furnish
a clue.

'-’ Much the same might be said
about this name as has been already
said as to its predecessor. The
temptation, of course, is to turn
one's eyes and thoughts in the di-
rection of the remarkable collection
of stones called the Bridestones. But
independently of the fact that this
is not really a pile or heap (acervus)
of stones, it would seem to be con-
siderably too much to the left or
west, and its position inconsistent,
moreover, with the terms of the
latter part of the description of the
line taken by the divisa. For the
statement is that it turns back from

Bacheler (retroductu), coming down
above Tripsdale until it reaches a
“ magna via ” or established road-
way coming from Turchilesti—-evi-
dently, by its name, another “way '⁷
or track—the said mad-way, being
such in locality aud direction that
it connects with the line of Williams-
beck. Under these circumstances a
much more than admissible hypo-
thesis is, that what is marked with
the word ‘ ‘ Badger Stone ” on the six—
inch survey, and from which point
the boundary between Bilsdale Kirk-
ham and Bilsdale Midcable runs to
Tripsdale Head, and thence along
Tripsdale Beck to where the stream
begins to be called Bilsdale Beck,
thence striking off to the west again
with a direct lead for WVilliamsbeck‚
is the existing representative of
Bacheler.

‘³ There is no doubt about this
name. The modern Tripsdale is so
little altered from the elder form that
recognition is inevitable.

“¹ From the mode of mention this
would, at first sight, be taken to be a
name indicative of locality merely—
the name of some thoroughly local-
ised steep path or road-track of no
great extent, like the short steep
“bank '’ from the old bridge below
VVesterdale Hall to the foot of the
village. But this would be a mis—
taken view : for Thurkersti is named
in the last document but one in the
Cartularium in such terms as to
prove that it is as much at home on
Skiplam Moor as here, just on
the confines of the limits of Cleve—
land. In the document referred to,
six loads of turves are granted to
Lucy, William Fowler's daughter,
year by year “in mora nostra de
Skipnum super Thurkirsti.'' Thur-
kelsti, then, is the name of a “sti ’'
or “ sty ”——and‚ that is to say, of a
pathway or “gate‚’² or roadway, of
very considerable length, the two
points just under ment10n being cer-
tainly six miles apart, or nearly‚—if
not more. And probably this cir-
cumstance may be almost sufficient
