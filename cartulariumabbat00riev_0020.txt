xvi INTRODUCTION.

is easy to speak of the “various and conflicting motives
that originated the foundation of religious houses,” and
to suggest ‘⁶ conscience—strichen pangs that were com-
fortably to be stifled by the bestowal of a superfiuity
which cost the giver nothing,⁷' the “death-bed conces-
sions that were to charter a seat in heaven by a foregone
inheritance in earth‚'' ² “ the operation of domestic grief
on superstition‚” and the like: but the question really
is whether such suggestion is very much better than a

species of clap-trap.

l prefer the tone and spirit of the

man who, although he is not an enthusiastic apostle of
the religion of Christ, yet recognises in the life of
Bernard of Olarevallis “ the greatness of the place he

dred and fifteen monasteries were
built during the nineteen years of
Stephen⁷s reign, more than had
been founded in the whole previous
century3 a hundred and thirteen
were added to these during the
reign of Henry. In half-a-century
sixty-four religious houses were built
in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire alone.
Monastery and priory . . . towered
above the wretched mud-hovels in
which the whole of the population
below the class of barons crowded.
. . . We may gain some faint idea
of the amazing stir and industry
which the founding of these monas·
teries implied, by following 111 our
modern farms and pasture-lands the
traces which may even now be seen
of the toil of these great preachers
of labour. The whole water—supply
of a countryside for miles round was
gathered up by vast drainage works3
stagnant pools were transformed into
running waters closed in by 0111110111(-
ments, which still serve as ditches
to the modern farmer ; swamps were
reclaimed that are only now pre-
served for cultivation by maintain-

ing the dykes and channels first cut
by mediaeval monks3 mills rose 011
the banks of the newly-created
streams ; roads were made by which
the corn of the surrounding villages
might be carried to the central mill,
and the produce of the land brought
to the central storehouse. The new
settlers showed a measureless cun-
ning and industry in reclaiming soil
hitherto worthless’' As the soberly
arrived-at conclusions of one of the
most competent historical inquirers
of our day, all this is surely well
worthy of attention. But, may we
not ask, were the results thus stated
alike unintended and unanticipated
both by founder and monor, and
scarcely even forecasted by the
monkish settlers themselves? For
something approaching to that would
be the conclusion we should be forced
upon if we accept the customary
claptrap sentimentalism about the
prevailing motives, as assumed, of
the great originators of many or
most of our most famous religious
houses.
