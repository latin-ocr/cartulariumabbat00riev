Adelina by Peter de 3008. Still
there is no question that there was
another son by this marriage. For
in Walter Espec's charter of founda-

810118 some little questioning ; namely,
that in 14 John “he took upon him
the habit of religion, whereupon the
custody of all he had, viz., Werke

tion of Rievaulx (No. XLII„ p. 16),
after the enumeration of eleven 168168,
18 added: “ Testimonio etiam et con-

filiorum mediae sororis 111666 Albreae ς
61 nepotum meorum Everardi et
Roberti, filiorum sororis meae Ode·
linae postgenitae.'' This is a state-
ment too distinct and precise to be
overlooked. Dugdale affirms that
Everard de Roos was a minor at his
father’s death, and a ward of Ranulph
de Glanville’s.

1 “Having married Rose, one of
the daughters and heirs of William
Trusbut (of VVartre, in Holderuess),
he died before the thirty—second year
of Henry 11., leaving her a young
widow, and two sons surviving5
whereof the eldest was then thirteen
years of age, and called Robert with
the addition of Fursan.’' It will be
observed that the other son is not
named in this Genealogy. Dugdale
also makes a further statement con-
cerning Robert Fursan, which occa-

Castle, with his whole barony, was
committed to Philip de Ulcote. But
therein he did not long continue (as
it seems) 3 for in January following’'
——the date of the assumed profession
being May 15, 1212—“the Shreev-
alty of Cumberland, and the forest
there were committed to his cus-
tody.’' But even without this pre-
cise statement, the part he took in
the baronial struggle with the King,
which resulted in the concession of
the Great Charter, 18 sufficiently
notorious to show that he had re-
turned to the world, if indeed he had
actually ever left it. That he became
a Templar, probably just before the
close of his lise, there is no uncer-
tainty about. One reason for think-
ing it was quite late in his life that
he retired to the Temple is that he
gave VVark Castle to his son Robert
in the eleventh year of Henry 111„
that being also the year of his own
death (Emonam, i. 546).

2 She is simply named Lucia in
the Genealogy. Dugdale alleges that
she was the daughter of Reginald
FitzPiers os Blewleveny in YVaIeS.

³ Described as “haeres de Dalbe-
nay ’' in the Genealogy.
