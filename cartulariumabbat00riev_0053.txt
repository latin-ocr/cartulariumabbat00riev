solitary place in Blakemor, surrounded by steep 111115
and covered with wood and ling ”1 as due to nothing
else than the rhetorical fancy of the limners, and when
we call to mind the vivid picture drawn in Bernard de
Baliol's yet 13161 charter of grant in Westerdale2—a
place of no greater ‘⁶ solitudo ’' or “horror ’' than
Rievaulx must then have been—no other conclusion is
possible save that the pioneers of the monastic work
and life in the dales of the Rie had a time of rough and
not quite dangerless experience to pass through. Rie-
vaulx may now “stand in hallowed beauty⁷'—and
would that its beauty were regarded inore in the spirit
and sense of the epithet 3---13111 111611 1116 descriptive
adjectives must have qualified tracts of an unreclaimed,

it as applied to a totally unreclaimed
place in the wilds of the vast, track-
less, desolate Blackhow Moor. Of
a part of the same district, not thirty
years ago, a man who had roughed
it all over the world nearly, and
was then Professor of Physiology in
a Queen’s College in Ireland, de-
scribed his ideas of it, after passing
over a limited and road-traversed
portion of the same, by the applica-
tion of the terms ‘⁵ a waste howling
wilderness. ⁷ ’

1 “A solitary place in Blake-
more, near Helmsley‚ surrounded
by steep hills and covered etc.’⁷
(Dugdale, v. 274.)

² See No. ccxxx: “Et pastores
eorum libere utentur cornubus in
eisdem pasturis propter bestias et
latrones.” . . . There can be no
mere figure of speech or rhetorical
artifice in the sober, matter-of-fact
terms employed in 311 ordinary
charter of benefaction or grant.

3 When last at Rievaulx (in No-
vember 1887) I was glad to see that

the ivy which was slowly but surely
sapping the stability of 1116 exterior
of the south end of the choir had
been removed, and that the same
precautionary measures were being
pursued elsewhere. But 31 1116 531116
111116 Ι saw but 100 many evidences
of the slow but sure processes of
‹lecay and ruin operating unchecked
in other parts of the venerable fabric.
In one place there had been a recent
fall involving destruction of features
of interest, and in another a large
mass, the fall of which would carry
away many tons of material, and
cause the utter destruction of the
openings of two windows, was only
kept from falling by the application
of ligatures and shores, which, 31
1116 1111110511, could be effectual in
3116111111,Γ 1116 threatened ruin and
loss 13111 for a few days—it might
even be hours z and I could not learn
that any orders for the est'ectual
averting of the threatened eata-
strophe had been or were likely to
136 issued.
