dale Nuns. He grants in a charter,
still extant, with a large seal appen-
ded, all his land in Aslackeby (now
Aislaby) in the county of Durham‚
to the Convent of St. Mary de Augo
in Normanby. The nature of the
connection between the Baliols and
Guido de Bovincourt is not evident.
But it is apparent that he was suc-
ceeded by the former in divers lord-
ships held by him in the north of
England. Reference to this grant
will be met with again below.

1 Another abstract of this charter
is given vol. cxlvi. 89, with a variant
copy of the seal, and with Harderne
in loco Bardene, Haworth for Haweth,
Holdeleia for Haldeneldebeia.

“-’ The presumption is that this must

be the first Abbot of Fountains of
this name, whose rule lay between
1203 and 12093 for Robert de Mei-
nill, the seventh in the list of
Testes, died in 1206.

³ The first of the name, who was
Abbot from 1194 to 1214.

4 The Grantor in this case may be
assumed to be the Philip de Colville
who married the heiress of the En-
gerams, lords of Arnchffi Dale, and
East Heslerton. It would seem that
she had been previously married, but
without offspring by her first hus-
band. At least she brought the
manors named to the Colvilles. Ro-
bert Engeram, the father of the lady
iu question, is among the Testes.
