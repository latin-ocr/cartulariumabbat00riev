1 At the close of a paper by the '⁴
Editor, published in the April num-
ber of the Antiquam! for 1886, 116
writes :—“ One matter remains to be
noted in connection with the ofizam
or ofizams concerned in the charters
we have adverted to, and that is the
date. From documentary evidence,
notably in the Whitby Chartulary,
and also, though less precisely, in
the Rievaulx Chartulary, Torphin de
Alverstein was dead by or before
1170, and his son Alan reigned in
his stead as lord of divers mauors,
which were part of the fec of his
father at the time the two charters
we have cited were drawn and rati-
fied. The enclosures named, then,
were of a (late scarcely a century
later than the Conquest itself, or
sufficiently early to explain the ap-
plication to them of a descriptive
term older by far than the Conquest
itself, but which had not yet had
time to become obsolete. And that,
I conceive, is the category under

which the word or name ofnam,
avenam, hoveuam, hovenlzam will
have, of necessity, to be placed. In
the Minutes and Orders of Quarter
Sessions, held at Riclnnond in Octo-
ber 1624, a ‘ warrant de withernani’
is mentioned, where the -mtm is
simply equivalent to taking, taking
possession of, from A.S. nima, to
take, seize. It is the same word as
in our name ostiam or ovenam, and
Bosworth gives us the verb ‘ osniman,
to take, seize.’ But the full force of
the A.S. preposition of is ‘from‚
out of3 de, e, ex.''' And thus the
clearly defined meaning of osizmvz, as
applied to an enclosure, is seen to be
land taken up from, or out of, a larger
tract hitherto unappropriated and
unenclosed3 in other words, a pur-
presture, encroaohnient, or intak' ;
which latter word is the word used 111
Clcveland to this day, involving the
idea of “taking in'' from the com-
mon, as ofnam does that of ‘⁶ taking
out of '' the same.
