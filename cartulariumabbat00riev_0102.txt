presided over the Abbey. For the document which is printed
as No. CCXLIII. contains passages and dates such that the only
reasonable construction which can be put upon them, so far as
I am able to see, warrants the conclusion that Sylvanus was
Abbot as early as 1170 3 and if that is so, it is unnecessary to
dwell upon the certainty that the two Abbots inserted in the
list here could have had no existence at the dates alleged.
The document in question is headed, “Cyrographum pacis
inter nos et Bellandenses,'' and in the preamble speaks of an
arrangement made between the two convents through the
provident 661111011 of the Abbots Aelred of Rievaulx and Roger
of Byland. It then proceeds to notice in detail divers matters
which had been subjects of controversy between the two
houses, but were amicably settled by the Abbots named, with a
variety of conditions of a prospective nature, and connecting
themselves with different and widely separated portions of the
possessions belonging to the several communities in places
where they chanced to have a common interest, many of Which
are alike interesting and instructive when the subject for con-
sideration is the history of either of the two establishments
named. After this the document proceeds thus:—“ Cum
autem haec conventio pluribus annis ab utroque in multis con-
servata fuisset, ΑΟ 61) Incarnatione Domini Mclxx, ne tepes—
ceret caritas mutua, iterato replicata et arctius est roborat-a,
additis quibusdam quae in priore conventione non continebantur,
et hoc praecipue etc.,'' going on to specify certain claims by
either party (which were to be finally dropped from that day
forward)‚ and to provide a mode of mutual arbitration sor any
occasions of dispute which might arise in the future. This
done, and the penalties for infraction of the rules laid down
provided, the document concludes thus :—“ Haec carta lecta est
in utroque Capitulo, praesentibus Abbatibus, Domino Silvano
Rievallense et Rogero Bellandensi‚ et tam ab ipsis quam
utroque Capitulo in perpetuum confirmata.'' After long and
patient consideration Ι find myself unable to dissever between
the date thus given and this public reading over and common
ratification by the two Chapters of the Conventio or agree-
ment. And if so, our conclusion is that Sylvanus was Abbot
as early as 1170. And admitting this, while on the one hand
the two dates quoted by Burton in connection with the alleged
Abbots‚ Roger and Bernard‚ are effectually set aside, the
interval during Which either of them, or both, could have pre-
sided‚ is narrowed to the period occurring between Aelred's
death in 1167, and the accession of Sylvanus‚ certainly before
1170. Burton gives 1189 as the year of his death, and as his
