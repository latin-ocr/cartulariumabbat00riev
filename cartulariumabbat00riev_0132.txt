1 This is written ‘ Rycaluegy,' y
being the final letter, and the mark
of contraction over the two last
letters. The name is met with
again in a Confirmation by Ed-
ward 111.‚ obtained from the Patent
Rons, an abstract of which will be

1620, discloses the fact that in the
name which is now written and
called Egton Grange, the latter or
terminal part was then written Graiu,
as also that there were several
“ grains ⁷' in the locality indicated,
and that the total area involved was

given in the sequel, and there the
reading 15 ‘ Ricolvegraines ’ beyond
doubt. Touching the locality it-
self, the editor of K irkby’s Juquest,
at p. 117 n.‚ writes-——“Ricolff, the
Ricalf of Domesday-Book, a lost
vill, which may have stood on
Riccal Moor, near the spot where
the road to Nunnington crosses the
river Riccal, and about half-way
between Muscoates and Harome.''
Perhaps the termination “grains”
is one which may be held to justify
something in the way of comment
or notice. It is not 6 word unknown
in the way of helping to form a
local designation. Thus, in the
parish of Egton there is a certain
area, or subdivision of the collective
whole of the township‚ called Eg-
ton Grange. But, as the editor has
observed in a note to p. 153 of
vol. iv. of the N orth Ridivq Records,
there neither was nor could be any
“ grange ” (that is, 6 farming estab-
lishment, whether monastic orother)
at the place so called. An Indenture
of Oonveyance, however, dated in

of considerable extent. And “ when
one remembers what the north-
country word ‘grain' implies, as
in the (smine of 6 fork, the gyrains of
a tree, 01· the O.N. hafs (Ji-ein, an
arm of the sea, there is no difficulty
in conceiving its application to the
branchings of 6 stream, or of the
valley which supplies its bed.'’ No
doubt Ricolveyrames was a locality
embracing a spot involving the—
so to say—confluence of two or more
sub-valleys‚ 01· mains.

² This 15 so written.

3 What the Barra de Hamelak
may have been must perhaps remain
uncertain. Bearing in mind what
the Bars at York, Searborough,
Boston, etc., were, but more parti-
cularly at such towns as those last
named, which were not ιι101·1’,1116(1”
in the proper sense of the word, we
have to assume that there was a
gateway of the same character at
Helmsley, at the place indicated.
I do not think it can be identified
with the gate of the castlc.
