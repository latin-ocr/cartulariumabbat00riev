however rough even, from the haste with which it had
to be run up. And then we picture to ourselves‚ per-2
haps, the nature of the buildings, if “buildings '' we can
call them, that were run up within the year for the
reception of the Prior and his twelve canons from Kirk-
ham at their settleinent in Lincolnshire. Or, perhaps,
we turn our pondering thought to the cyrograph between
Rievaulx and Kirkham, and refiect that if perchance
the various buildings specified therein were actually
completed within the year fron] 13110 ratifying of the
agreement—a contingency absolutely contemplated in
0110 of the conditions specified toward the end of the
document—those several buildings, so precisely cata—

understand by the terni “ substantial,'' and could never,
in any sense or in any part, have been the buildings

designed to stand for good, and designed accordingly.1

the truth is that since that note
not only was written, but printed,
further inquiry and consideration
have led me to give it up as involv-
ing too many difficulties. It will be
observed, that the material to be
employed in the construction of the
aforesaid parts of the conventual

whom I have conversed or corre-

of adopting this conclusion appear
to me after maturet· thought and
consideration to be twofold:-(l.)
