mentioned in the last reference. In his case, again, Bur-ton
makes reference to the Chronicle of Melmse.

15. ἯΙΜᾸΑΜ IV.—-In a Fine levied in 1268, before Peter de
Brus, and the other Justices then itinerant, William, Abbot of
Rievaulx‚ was one of the parties, and Robert de Teesdale‚ with
his wife Gundreda, the other. For his date, 2 Kal. Aug.
1275, Burton quotes Torr’s MSS.; according to Placita Ebor.,
1279-1281, 116 was summoned by Willialn, Prior of Kirkham,
to show cause why he should not permit the latter to have
the pasturage in Bilsdale of which he had been dispossessed
by Abbot Adam3 and No. CCXLIX. is a Fine, dated in 1281, in
which he is one of the principals‚ and John de Staingrave the
other. But there is yet one matter which, in connection with
this Abbot, remains to be glanced at. Burton's date and refer-
ence have already been quoted, aud the question arises whether
the 2 Kal. Aug, as alleged on the authority of Torr's MSS„ may
not be a mistake for 12 Kal. Aug. in the same year, when,
from the following minute in Archbishop Gifford's Register, it
is apparent he made his profession of obedience z—-“ Obedientia
fratris Willelmi, Abbatis Ryevallis, facta apud Cawod sub
datum xii Kal. Augusti, AD. Meclxx quinto, sub hiis verbis:
Ego frater WVillelmus, Abbas Ryevallis, subjectionem, reveren-
tiam et obedientiam a sanctis patribus constitutam, secundum
regulam S. Benedicti, tibi, Pater Archiepiscope‚ tuisque suc-
cessoribus canonice substituendis, et Sanctae Sedi Ebor., salvo
Ordine nostro, perpetuo me exhibiturum promitto.'’ Such an
entry admits of 110 doubt as to the fact and date stated. But
on this admission depends the consequence that having been
Abbot since 1268—and how much before that we do not know
——he had allowed so many years to elapse previously to laying
this obligation upon himself. Of course there is the hypo-
thetical alternative that another Abbot of the same name had
been interposed between him and Abbot Adam. A like post-
ponement of profession occurs in the case of one or more of the
Abbots of Furness, and the present, it may be, is not the only
case of the kind among the Abbots of RievaUIX.

16. Tfloms 1.—-This Abbot stands ISth in the monasticon
Catalogue, and set before his name is the date Non. Dec. 1286,
while the note of reference below is “ Reg. William Grencfeld,
archiep. Ebor., pt. lst, p. 31.'’ As Grenfeld was not Archbishop
until 1306, there is obviously some confusion or mistake
involved. Abbot Thomas made his profession at wilton, iv
Non. Februarii, in the first year of the l‘ontificatc of Arch-
