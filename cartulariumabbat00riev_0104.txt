was succeeded by William de Punchard‚ who (1166 from three
to four years later. There is no room, therefore, for Abbot
Godfrey, if there were an Abbot so named, until some time in
12033 and in 1204, according to the extract from the Melrose
“ Chronica ’² given a little above, it is stated that an Abbot
named Gaufridus (or Geoffrey) became the ecclesiastic-al head
01 1116 Ηο1166. Clearly then it must be assumed, not only that
it is out of the question to insert an Abbot Godfrey between
Sylvanus and Ernald, or between Ernald and William (16
Punchard, but that the only possible supposition is that the
Abbot called Godfrey in the accredited lists 01 Abbots of
Rievaulx must be identical with the Abbot called Gaufridus
by the Melrose Chronicler, and that his proper place in the
catalogue is immediately in 611006661011 10 William Punchard.
But to return to Abbot Ernald. He begins his rule as Abbot

the (late 1132 printed by mistake 101 1192), and in his note
thereto adds,——“Ivo de Wartre occurs Prior in A.D. 1192,
being cotemporary with Ernald, Abbot of Rieval, and William,
Prior 01 Kirkham, in the first year 01 1116 pontificate 01 Pope

those 01 the witnesses to a charter by Bishop Pmlsey, together
with that of Abbot William 01 Newminster (Archbishop Gray's
Register‚ ὃὸ. p. 39 11). For 1199 as the date 01 1116 resigna-
tion 01 1116 office of Abbot, and for the fact of the resignation
itself‚ Burton quotes 0111071.ᾱο Mauros, p. 181. But there is
in the sanie record another entry which contains what 16
unquestionably a reference to Abbot Ernald, which is not
altogether free from obscurity. It is 011 p. 180, and runs
thus :—“ Anno Mcxciv, Dominus R[einerius]‚ vii. Abbas de
Melros, curam pastoralem sigillo 6110 Abbati E[rnaldo] de
Rievalle humiliter assignavit, scil, xv Kal. Octobris, i.e. Sabbato;
cui successit Radulphus, Abbas de Kinlos.'’ From the date,
there can be no hesitation about conipleting the name, the
initial of which only is given 3 and the inference appears to be
that the Abbot 01 Rievaulx was the person specially deputed
to receive the formal resignation of the retiring prelate.
