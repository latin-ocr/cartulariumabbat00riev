INTRODUCTION.

But with all these musings and ponderings, we allow

for the erection of a choir of stone, however short, and

modern, so far as Ι am aware, gives
any word the least like “spuor‚''
either in form or suggestion, taking
stone, squared, or in any form, as the
signification intended ; and it is sel-
dom indeed that a word is met with
so utterly isolated as that comes to.
But again, 2. Four important parts
of the conventual establishment
(besides the seven others specified
“ of some other material '') are to be
constructed in “spuor,’' and more
than only possibly within the year.
To build a church—and allowing
only for the choir—for thirteen pro-
fessed brethren, besides conversi, and
allowing for the influx of so many
new-coniers as are implied in the
sending out of so many drafts to
furnish new Abbeys elsewhere—and
chapter-house, dorter, and frater,
on the same scale, in hewn stone,
is simply impossible. The con-
struction on that wise of a small
parish church, under the existing
circumstances of a still only growing
commuiiity—say, such as is pre-
sented to our view and appreciation
in the almost contemporary choir at
Lastingham—could not have been
effectually completed within such
limits of time. Taking these diffi-
culties into consideration, I feel my-
self constrained to differ in view
with the authorities mentioned
above as to the probable meaning
of “spuor,'’ and in preference to
adopt the theory that the word in
question may be a connection—
possibly disguised by scribe or
copyist’s mistakc—of the old word
which has come down to us in
the form “span'’ ‘⁴ Fyr sperris‚”
“sparrys de quercu‚’' “spcrris dc
abiete‚’⁷ are familiar niediaeval terms,

and it is a matter equally familiar
that houses, churehes, even castles,
were wholly or in part built of tim-
ber. “ The use of wood for domestic
architecture long after this time,'’—
the eleventh century—says Profes-
sor Freeman (Norm. Con. ii. 606),
“ need not be dwelt upon, and there
is abundant evidence of the use of
wood in fortification at this time
and later. . . . Stone was at this
time fast coming into use for do-
mestic, as well as for military and
ecclesiasticae buildings.” Previously
then the material in use must have
been wood, or modifications depend-
ing on the use of wood. As an
illustration simply, let me advert to
Greensted church, constructed, as
there seems no reason to doubt, in or
about the year 1013, to receive the
body of St. Edmund. The entry in
a record preserved in the Monaste‘con
is “Idem apud Aungre (Ongar ;
Greensted having been formerly
parcel of Ongar) hospitabatur, ubi in
ejus memoria lignea capella per-
manet usque hodie.⁷' In my Essex
boyhood this chapel of wood was
still the parish chureh of Greensted,
and this is the description 2—“The
nave is formed of the half trunks of
oaks, about a foot and a half in
diameter, split, and roughly hewn
at each end, to let them into a sill
at the bottom, and into a plank at
the top, where they are fastened
with wooden pegs. It is 29 feet 9
inches long, 14 feet wide, and 5 fect
6 inches high on the sides which
supported the primitive roof. On
the south side there are sixteen
trunks and two door-posts3 on the
north twenty—one, and two vacancics
fillcd up with plaster. The west
