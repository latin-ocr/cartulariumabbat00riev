1 Geoffrey Plantagenet, a natural
son of Henry ΙΙ., was elected Arch-
bishop of York in 1189, although not
consecrated until nearly two years
later. Henry 11. died in July 1189.
Consequently this confirmation must
date from the earlier part of that

the following giggestionp by Mr. Wff
Brown of Arncliff Hall may not be
without value. Premising that he
can find no Archbishop Geoffrey con-
temporaneous with Henry 11., and
adverting to the fact that there were
two places called Bures or Burum
at which King Henry is known
to have been, the one, Bures-le-Roi‚
and the other Bures simply, and
that, with one exception, only the
former is to be understood when

Burum is mentioned in connection
With the said King, he goes on to
say that Henry 11., in July 1171,
made a charter at Buroum, which
Eyton takes to be Bures-le-Roi, in
favour of Newstead Abbey, to which
Geoffrey, Archdeaoon of Canterbury,
was witness. This same Geoffrey
was also witness 10 6 charter by the
younger King Henry (who pre-
deceased his father), at the same
time and place. In both these char-
ters Geoffrey is the first witness.
Can the “Archiepiscopo” in No.
601. be a mistake for “Archidia-
cono”? Bures-le-Roi is, Ι take it,
the Bures St. Mary’s of the present
day, and derived its older name from
the fact that Eadmund, King of the
East Angles, was crowned there,
according to the testimony of Geof-
frey de Fontibus.
