Et quia praedicta Steintuna est de jure et haereditate mea, ego
Monachis de Rievalle clamo eam quietam pro 1116 et haeredibus

quod singulis annis reddent michi et haeredibus meis duas
marcas argenti, unam ad Pentecosten, aliam ad festum S.

1 The modern Scawton.

2 No trace of this name remains 111
the locality it must have found a
home in. For its vicinity is dis-
tinctly marked by the particulars
given. A part of the course of the
stream dividing Scawton ¹from Old
Byland, and that the part nearest
its confluence with the Rye, and a
part of the Rye itself, of course
downwards from such confluence,
are two of the four boundaries of
Oswaldengs. But, as will be seen,
the difficulty is in fixing the limits
alleged under the other names in-
volved.

⁸ Should any reader have noted
that the name W elburn is, in the
series of documents occupying a
somewhat earlier place in the pre-
sent collection, almost invariably
written lVelbrun, the suggestion
will be that, in all probability,
Brunesdale here is simply Burnsdale.
Unquestionably‚ beck· is the universal
word in all this part of Yorkshire
for a running stream3 but it is as
little open to question that burn,
with the same sense, has been at
some time current in the same dis-
trict ; that, in fact, it has been super-
seded by beck. Why burn should
have survived in more northerly
parts of the kingdom, and beck be

0

Nor, perhaps, is the solution far to
seek. But the fact remains that
burn was once in use, and that it
has been supplanted by beck. An-
other thing to be noted is that dale,
in local names, is by consent looked
upon as, in the district in question,
of cognate origin with beck—in other
words, equally scandinavian. Cer-
tainly it may not be possible to
prove that the name Burndale or
Burnsdale is not of Anglian origin:
but it is greatly more probable that
it is of Danish origin ; and if so, then
the burn that survived in the name
Burndale was the designatiou of a
stream sufficiently marked to be
called—had it been in our own days—
“the burn.'' Then comes the identi-
fication in terms of the spring which
gives rise to the stream which runs
through the said dale—that is to
say, the application of the term keld.
Assuming Brunsdale to be a name
of the suggested character, it is to
be supposed that the name would
not easily be lost or forgotten. Now,
there is a Bungdale in close proximity
to the required locality, and it is by
no means impossible that it may
represent Brundale. For the sound
is the alternative of Brun, and that
