we find a singular meagreness of detail in the matter we
are desiring to obtain information about. Take Burton,
for instance : “ 1122. 1. William, rector of Garton, uncle
to Walt. Espec, the founder, was the first prior. 2.
Between A.D. 1190 . . . William occurs. 3. About 1195
and 1 199 Drogo occurs. 4. Andreas occurs.’' Fortunately
the present Chartulary enables us to supplement this
unsatisfactory array, at all events as far as follows 2—1.

William, 1 122.

2.¹ O. or D.2 before 1135.
before 1140, and, I conclude, after 1145.3

3. Wallevus ;
4. Drogo.4

5. William de Muscamp, between 1190 and 1227 ‚5

¹ By the insertion of these nume-
rals, it must not be understood that
it is intended to assert that the
Priors, before whose names they are
set, actually occurred in that precise
order3 but only that they occur in
this relative order, and that one or
more names of early Priors may still
be wanting. I am, for instance, un·
certain if this Prior of doubtful
name was in reality the second
prior. He may have been the third.
If Prior William of Garton only
lived a year or two after his eleva-
tion to the Priorate (as is believed),
the present Prior may well have
been the third in succession.

2 See No. ccxxxw. When engaged
with the transcription of the contents
of the Cartularium in the British
Museum, I read this initial as O.
It did ‘not seem to be perfectly clear
that it was O, but Ι did think it was
more likely to be O than any other
letter. In Dodsworth's transcript
(ῙΧ. 162b.) the initial is written D.
The date given in the text is so given
because the document is addresscd
to King Henry 1. (ob. 1135), and
Archbishop Thurstan.

3 See No. ccxxxv. As to the first
of the dates given, XValbran, in a
note on p. 180 of the paper 011 Kirk-

ham, more than once referred to
above, writes: “In 1139, on the
feast of St. Hilary, the Earl of
Albemarle, who has been styled
“proeclarus comes et eximius monas-
teriormn semdator,'' founded the
Priory of Thornton in Lineolnshire ;
and in the following year, and on the
same feast, Waltheof—-his kinsman,
and Prior of Kirkham—went to
Thornton, taking with him twelve
Canons of Kirkham, whom he estab-
lished in the new monastery, consti-
tuting one of them, named Richard,
the first Prior.’' Mr. VValbran does
not quote his authority : but there is
no doubt on the subject. As to the
second of the two dates, as the
charter cited mentions the Rievaulx
part of Bilsdale as now in the pos-
session of the Convent, and as there
is no reason to discredit the state-
ment as Espec’s grant of Bilsdale,
and the date of it, made in No.
cconxvm„ we may regard the said
date as assured.

⁴¹ There is ample space for Burton's
Prior Drogo here. But so far, I have
met with no confirmation of such a
position in the list. No doubt he
was Prior, but when is uncertain.

Robert de Ros 11.‚ and his name
