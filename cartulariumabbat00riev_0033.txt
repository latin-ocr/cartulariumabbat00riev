INTRODUCTION. xxix

The name of the Prior who stands third in the list
thus supplied of course answers the question, Who was
the Prior at the time? and Wallevus (or lValdevus) is
but another and Latinised form of Walthe0f‚ the name
of one who was kinsman to the earl of Albemarle1 as
well as prior of Kirkham. And as such he stands forth
a man honourable by consanguinity, able besides—and
for the selfsame reason—to command the aid of
competent and important auxiliaries in any “ church-
extension '¹ work—as it was understood then—well and
wisely organised, as it was sure to be in such hands.

And now the question ariseS, lVas this scheme, of
the reality as well as the nature of which we are assured
by this cyrograph or agreement of cession between the
two Houses of Rievaulx and Kirkham, nullified or frus-
trated by the action of Prior Waltheof in taking the
part he did in heading 2 the colony of canons who went
to occupy the new Priory at Thornton?

This is an inquiry which would be less complicated,
and involved in less obscurity, if we had clearer and
more definite information as to the circumstances of the
arrangement between the monks of Rievaulx and the
canons of Kirkham; if we knew exaetly not only what

will be seen in several places among
those of the Testes to charters of
that period. He is, no doubt, the
William to whose name is prefixed
the number 2 in Burton's list, with
the incompleta “Betwixt 1190

‘-' I use the word “heading '³ ad-
visedly. The statement is that

Prior waltheof took with him
“ twelve canons of Kirkham.'’ But

twelve canons, without himself, on
such a mission, would have been an
imperfect number. The inference‚
therefore, certainly is, that 011 leaving
Kirkham he purposed becoming him-
self the first head of Thornton, and
that his making Richard the first
Prior simply implies that he changed
his mind and returned to Kirkham,
where, wc have no reason to doubt,
he remained Prior for several years,
six or seven at least.
