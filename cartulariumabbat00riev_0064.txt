lviii INTnonucTION.

and thus we are led on to the identification of Stainton,
a township in Downholme parish, about six miles west
of Richmond, and no great way from Ellerton Abbey, as
the Stainton which the said Walter de Gant, who died
in 1138, gave to Rievaulx ‘⁶ ab abbatiam construendam
ibi.'' And we may further notice that it was this
VValter’s son, Gilbert, who married Hawyse, daughter
of William de Romara (named just above as the founder
of Revesby Abbey), whose name is found among those
of the early benefactors of Rievaulx Abbey. He died
indeed, in 1156.

But quite independently of the mistake as to the site
of Stainton, there seems to be absolutely no reason dis-
cernible for the representation that the monks of Rievaulx
either meditated, or had a motive for meditating, the
removal of their house in the year 1158, or indeed in
any other year, and either to Stainton or anywhere else.
They may have meditated sending a draft of monks
thither, as it appears they did to Melrose, to Revesby,
to VVardon 3 but we have nothing on which to rest the
positive statement that they ever really devised any
such plan as that of removal from Rievaulx. Indeed,
when we consider the draiu upon their resources in men
that must have been occasioned by furnishing these
daughters of the house with the number of monks
required, and the further fact that the grant by thc
King of Man, probably contemporaneous, or nearly con-
temporancous, with their own foundation, was, and no
doubt necessarily, suffered to go by default, the prc-
sumption that they could not have contemplated any
such step as even this modified projcct involves, at the
