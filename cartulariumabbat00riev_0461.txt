left is mouldering away year by year
for want of a little fostering care and
protective expenditure. On every
consideration, what is still spared
for the admiration and instruction
of the ever-increasing number of
thoughtful and inquiring students of
the past, its works and its history,
ought not only to be as carefully
preserved—at least saved from the
effects of unresisted ruin and decay—
as can be done by the application of
modern skill aud science, but what
there is recorded in stone in that
which is left (and both under the
present surface as well as above),
committed to the more enduring
record of faithful and appreciative
description at the hands of a man,
or body of men, uniting the necessary
historical and technical knowledge.
In the case of the two Monasteries
cited above, it is seen that there is
no difficulty about the provision of
the necessary funds for one part at

least of what is named in the pre-
ceding paragraphs ; and there is
little reason to doubt that the rest
would be forthcoming, were it gene-
rally known that it would be suit-
ably and worthily expended. The
Editor has reason to conclude, as the
result of inquiries made on the spot,
that at the rate of sixpence a head,
levied on all the visitors to the Abbey,
a total sum of more thanAElOO would be
annually realised ; and from what he
has seen himself, of what lies almost on
the surface, or only slightly shrouded
by the sward and lighter debris, it is
simply impossible to estimate what
actual and most interesting discov-
eries, as well as preservations, might
be accomplished with even that sum
annually set apart for the purpose.

1 A canopy. “The verb to ciel,
seile, or syce is purely an English
formation from the older sb. syle or
cyll, a canopy '⁷ (Skeat).
