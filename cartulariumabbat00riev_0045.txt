dicitur. Cum quibus missus est XVillelmus, primus

Rievaulx is subjoinecl in a note—“Rievaux was the
earliest Cistercian house in the north of England, and
Prior John of Hexham could not pass over the founda-
tion of a monastery which was the mother of Melrose,
and was presided over by the famous Aelrecl, who was
a native of Hexham, a place which had good reason to
remember him? And further, “Anno 1132, tertio
nonas Martii, facta est Abbatia Sanctae Mariae de
Rei-valle, die Sabbati,⁷⁷ says the historian of Melrose
(Chron. ed. Bann. Club, 69), “ancl this is the date
usually given. The donation, however, which brought
the monks to that place had been made in 1131, when
L’Espec gave Grif et Tilestona to St. Bernard for the
construction of an Abbey (Chart. de Rievaux, Mss.
Cotton„ Julius D.). The Chronicle of Sigebert correctly
ascribes the beginning of Rievaux to this year (German.

such clear and easy connection that the reasonableness
of what is advancecl cannot but recommend itself to our
regard. Perhaps, too, there may be something in the
sentences involving the naming of the later date, which
suggests something in the way of question or inquiry.
The description given of Espec is, to say the least, a
little startling. “Miles strenuus Conquestoris.⁷' It
supposes him to bc a man past the first flush of youth,
