Savaric, Abbot of York, the first
Abbot Richard of VVhitby, Prior
Cuthbert of Guisborough‚ and Arch-
bishop Henry Murdac of York. The
latter was Archbishop from 1147 to
1153 (see Whitby Chartulary, pp.
164, 165, and notes). There is then,
it is more than likely, a gap in the
succession of Priors, sor William
Muschamp, “Prior de Kirkhame‚’'
in No. XLVII„ is 0 contemporary of
Robert (Fursan) de Ros, who had
livery of his lands, etc., in 1190-1.
Again, in No. XLV111., William, Prior
of Kirkham, is mentioned among the
Testes. He is, no doubt, the Wil-
liam Muschamp of the preceding
charter. But there is a NValter,
Prior of Kirkham‚ named in this
same Robert Fursan’s grant of Privi-
lege to the Burgesses of Helmsley,
the date of which, Ι think, has not
been ascertained. However, the
Grantor died before 1226-7. There
is further a confirmation by William
de Ros, 3011 of the aforesaid Robert
Fursan, of a grant by his father in
aid of 0 pitancia to the Convent, to
be enjoyed 011 the Feast of All
Saints yearly, the first witness to
which is William, Prior of Kirkham.
This may be the william just pre-
viously noticed. And there is a yet

’ further Prior William, whose name

occurs once and again (as will be

noted in the sequel) about the year
1280, a little before and a little after.
Yet another Prior, unmentioned in
Burton’s list, will be met with below,
and 111 two places 3 but as in either
instance the mention is made in a
confirmation only, there is more of
the indefinite, as regards date, than
even in the case of an undated
charter. Robert FitzThomas Baro
de Graistoke, confirms to Rievaulx
“lx 00103 terrae arabilis in waldo
de Folketon quas habent de dono
Ricardi, Prioris, et Conventus S.
Trinitatis de Kirkeham.'’ Now
Thomas de Greystock and his wife
Agnes (widow of Thomas de Pen-
nington) had transactions with the
Convent of Furness in 1254, having
become man and wife certainly with-
in the preceding seven years or so.
But the identification of Robert Fitz·
Thomas de Greystock remains to be
effeeted. He was probably grand-
son of the Thomas who married De
Pennington's widow, and who would
appear to have left issue by another
wife, the daughter of Robert de
Veteriponte, two sons, Thomas and.
william, and 0 daughter (see Dods-
All that ean
that Robert

worth, iii. f. 40).
be added here is
FitzThomas's confirmation was sanc—
tioned by Royal Confirmation dated
1332.
