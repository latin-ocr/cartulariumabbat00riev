the first statement in it is this: “In principio datae
sunt ix carucatae terrae B. Bernardo, Abbati Clare-

in these extracts, and see if no mode of reconciling the
apparently discordant or conflicting views presents
itself. “It would appear probable‚⁷' says Mr. lValbran,
Memoriccls of Fomztctins‘, Preface, p. xxiv, “that tho
mission sent by St. Bernard from Clairvaux was directed
immediately into Yorkshire. Turstin was personally
