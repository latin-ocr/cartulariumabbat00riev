176 GARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.

fratrum de Rievalle in eadem terra stabit in perpetuum, ita quod
Rievallenses non transibunt versus fratres de Fontibus, nisi
cum assensu illorum, nec fratres de Fontibus transibunt versus
fratres de RievaHe, nisi cum assensu illorum, excepto quod1
fratres de Fontibus pasturam bobus carrucarum suarum versus
fratres de Rievalle acquirere poterunt, praeter terram Everardi
de Ros, in qua nichil omnino acquirent. Pratum quoque
quod tunc habebant eis liberum constabit3 pasturam tamen
boum ubi poterunt ordinate sibi acquirent. Fo[o]alliam vero
et materiem lignorum ubicunque poterunt eis acquirere licebit,
et salinas et pischarias versus mare, quantum poterunt. Et
ut haec [14710] compositio rata in perpetuum perseveret, cum
assensu totius Capituli confirmamus et sigillorum nostrorum
impressione roboramus.

² Roger‚ Abbot of Byland, is named

by Burton, in his Gataloyue of A bbots,
as occurring in 1142. In No. ccxxv.
we have Archbishop Roger’s confir—
mation> of the pactum named in the
present deed, among the witnesses to
which were John, Treasurer of York,
Robert, Archdeacon of York, Arch—
deacon Bartholomew, and John Fitz-
Letold, who is as yet only Canon of
York, and not advanced to the archi-
diaeonal office. The confirmation
therefore may date not long after
1154, the year of Archbishop Rogcr's
accession. ¹

as is also the further fact, established
by the present document (which will
be more fully notieed in a subsequent
note), that Abbot Roger of Byland
was also contemporary with Abbot
Sylvanus of Rievaulx. Touching
Abbot Ailred, who is among the
Testes to No. cxmx. in the Whitby
Chai-tulary, I have remarked in a
note there (p. 164) that “Burton
only gives 116- towards the date of
this Abbot3 but that,'' from the
document annotated, “it is clear
that he must have been Abbot before
1153.” But much more than this
may be alleged. In an instrument
