XX IN TRODUCTION.

Without counting the duplicate just now referred to,
there are in the Rievaulx Chartulary itself five principa]
There are the
two Fundationes, the indenture or agreement, and two
shorter pieces headed “Carta de Kirkeham de decimiS,''
and “ Carta de Kirkaham secunda 3 '² ¹ and it is from these
documents that such inductions must be made as are

documents connected With Kirkham.

reasonably possible.

In the first place, I would remark that neither of the
documents ticketed with the label “ F undatio '' can in
any true sense be regarded as the original foundation
deed at all.2 For although they differ in date, and
perhaps by from five to seven, or even eight years, yet
the earlier of the two postdates the foundation of
Rievaulx. For in the said earlier of the two F undatio
documents there stands this decisive sentence :—“ Et
pro decima quinque carucatarum de Tillestona, et pro
decima quatuor carucatarum de Grif, et pro omnibus
quae Canonicis pertinebant, quoe modo habent Abbas ct
monachi Rievallenses, donavi eis meum purprestum de
Kircham, et domos meas, et molendinum, et prata mea,

pieces, but I wish to be understood

{S speaking only of the original
eeds.

² It may be remarked that in the
Cartularium itself greater reticence
or cautiori in the description of the
deeds mentioned is very observable.
Thus the first of the two copies (No.
CCXVI.) of what is labelled by Dods-
worth as “ Secunda fundatio de
Kirkhani‚'‘ is simply headed with
“ Transcriptum cartae (18 Kircha1n‚⁷'

while the indenture or agreement
(No. CXLIX.) is noted as “Cyro-
graphum inter nos et Kirkeham.”
What is in reality the final settle-
ment of endowment by &Valter
Espec is derived from Dodsworth
(IX. fo. 157), and is headed “Fun-
datio Monasterii de Kirkham in
Com. Eboracensi‚’' but whether that
heading is a part of the document
itself, or merely a title prefixed
by the copyist, there is no means
of deciding, any more than there
is of determining from what source
the said copyist obtained it.
