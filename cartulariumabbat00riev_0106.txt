xcvi INTRODUCTION.

catalogue the date 1224 is prefixed to his number and name,
his predecessor having died in 1223. “ Haec est finalis con-
cordia etc., inter Rogerum, Abbatem Rievallis‚ querentem, et
Ricardum de Sproxtona, deforciantem, etc.'' (Feet of Fines,
1226). No. CCXVII. is a similar document, dated January
1232, between Abbot Roger and William de Ros3 No. CCCX11.‚
dated Pentecost 1233, 13 a lease 01 the Poketo Mill to New-
borough, bearing this Abbot’s name3 in 1234 there is a Finalis
concordia between Abbot Roger and Robert le Bulur, with
Amabel his wife, and yet again, there is another arrangement
01 the same kind, dated in 1235, between the same Abbot and
Robert de Everingham and Isabella his wife, with interesting
details as to the property involved in the case, the document
being printed in the Appendix 3 and lastly, in the Coram Rege
Pleas, Easter, 23 Henr. ΠΙ. (1233), Abbot Roger sues William
de Ros for warranty 01 the Grif and Tilston lands, and other
particulare 01 Espec's original grant. He resigned in 1239

(Chr. dc Mauros).

13. LEONIAS (LEONIUS).—“ Leonias de Dundraynon, a monk
01 Melros'' is the entry in the Μοηαείῑόοη, with the date 1238
prefixed to the name, but without the usual citatior] 01 autho-
rity. The last note will suffice to show that the statement is
one made, partly at least, in error. The Chronica entry touching
his accession to the Abbacy is “ Anno MccxxxiX‚ Dominus
Rogerus, Abbas Rievallis, suo cessit officio, et Dominus Leonius
de Dundraynan, et monachus de Melros, successit.'' According
to the sanie authority (p. 203), he had been appointed Abbot
01 Dundrennan in 1236, the day before the feast 01 the Ascen-
sion3 and, 011 the same page as stands the notice 01 1113 succes-
sion to the Abbot’s stall at Rievaulx, is also the notice 01 1113
death: “Anno Mccxl, obiit venerabilis Leonius, Abbas Rie-
vallis‚ vi idus Januarii; cui successit, post Pascha, Dominus
Adam 110 Tilletai, Abbas.”

14. ADAM DE T1LLETA1.—-Burt011 correctly (see last note)
prefixes the date 1240 to his mention 01 this Abbot. The same
date stands in No. CCLXXV11.; while in Fines dated in that year,
and the following years, noted 111 the list, his name appears
ten times at the least. No. CCCXXHI. is a fine dating 111 1257,
wherein Abbot Adam is the plaintiff, and William 110 Moubray
the defendant3 and finally, No. CCCXIV„ dated 111 1260, gives up
his name as entering into a composition with the personage—-
Simon de Vere—who was 111 reality one of the principals
