lxxii INTRODUOTION.

Still, with all this mutual illustration between ancient
document and existing features of the locality, I am
unable to consider that all the explanation needed has
been supplied. There is a degree of obscurity affecting
the earlier charter still remaining. There can be no
doubt, I think, that the canal system adopted at Rie-
vaulx was not one and single, or undivided: on the
contrary, transient observation seems to be sufficient for
creating the conviction that it was made up of two
