ment made concerning this previous grant at p. 11, is as
follows :—‘ Certa terra in Mannia data fuit Abbathiae
de Rievalle ad construendam abbatiam de Russia.
Postea, tamen, data fuit Abbatiae de F urnesio, ad con—
stituendam eam de Ordine Cisterciensi, ubi modo situata

Beck’s comment upon this is———‘ the ground had been
previously granted to the Abbey of Rievaux for the
purpose of building a monastery there. But the monks
of that House not availing themselves of the donation, it
was transferred to Furness.⁷ ⁷⁷ Mr. Beck adds, in a note,
that “the notices of this occurrence are involved in
confusion,’⁷ but much of the confusion is of his own

he ignores, or else is ignorant of, the fact that Rievaulx
was a house of the Cistercian Order from the beginning,
as Furness was eventually. For the facts as stated are
clear enough. “The grant in question was first made
to Rievaulx. That Abbey, however, was not founded
till 1131, and possibly not till a year or two later, . . .
and one thing is fairly clear, namely, that, taking the
later date as the practical one, the only just nascent
Abbey was not in a very good position for undertaking,
at Olaf's desire, ‘abbatiam constituere' in the Isle of
Man, or anywhere else, for the monks would have
their hands full with their own home building opera-

Probably the general tenor of these extracts, taken
with what has been advanced in some nearly preced-
ing paragraphs, will be regarded as a sufficient notice of
the circumstance under consideration. Or, at least, the
