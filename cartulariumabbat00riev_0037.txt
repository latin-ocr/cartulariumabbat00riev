INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

the motives which led to the formation of this plan of
surrender on the part of Kirkham, and to the arrange-
ment of the terms on which it was to be carried into
effect, have passed it by entirely without notice. All
the canons and brethren of Kirkham were to have—of
course after the arrangement agreed upon had taken
effect—the same status in Chapter and in the Cistercian
Order, as any monk whatever belonging to the said
Order. But the canons of Kirkham were Augustinians.

willingness existed, or no such clause as this final one

de Kirkaham '' ; or, “ lVallevus, Prior, et Capitulum
Ecclesiae Kirkhamensis,” but with “Haec sunt illa quae
concessimus . . . monachis de Rievalle ’² ; and further,

of the document we find them—these same “ west—
in set terms declaring not only that they will not
remove from Kirkham, but that they will not part With
their Prior until all the conditions stated shall have been
fully complicd with and satisfied in all points: “ Non
voluimus amittere Priorem nostrum.''

There seems to me to be but one solution to the ques-
