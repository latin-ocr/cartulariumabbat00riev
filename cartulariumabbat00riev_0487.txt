¹ See p. 1, No. I. There are
three paper leaves at the beginning
of the Cartularium preserved in the
Museum, which supplies all the
material for the first 204 pages of
the present volume. These three
paper leaves are followed by four
leaves of parchment. The fourth
parchment leaf is numbered l, and
is folded in six, and on it is written
what is headed ‘ ‘ Genealogy of Roos. ⁷’
I had originally intended to print
this in its place at the head of the
Chartulary; not as a perfect and
entirely correct genealogy, but as an
integral part of the Cartularium, and
Ι regret now that I did not do so.
What is printed here is, however,
mainly derived from it; and I append
in these notes anything of interest
which is to be found in the said
‘⁶ Genealogy ’' and is not included in
the text.

² The first line 111 the Genealogy
contains the single name Espec, with
a blank after it, indicating that his
wife’s name and family were un-
known. It may be mentioned here,
in passing, that there can be little,
if any, doubt that he was the william
Spech whose name is found, among
those of other Tenants in capite, in
the Bedfordshire Domesday, as hold—
ing Wardon and other manors at the
date of the said record. The second
line gives as the first of the three
daughters of Espec, “ Hauuisia, uxor
Willelmi Buscy ”3 second “Albreda,

uxor Nicholai Trayly ’'; third, “Ade-
lina, uxor Petri, Domini de Ros,
qui sepultus est Rievalle ”; and then
follows Walterus Especszdelina,
uxor WValteri, with the following
commentary subjoined : ‘ ⁴ miles stren-
uus Conquestmis, tria fundavit
monasteria: 1. de Kirkham, A.D. 1122
(22 vel 23 Henr. Ι.); 2. de Rievall„
1133 (33 vel 34 Henr. Ι.); 3. de
WVardon, 1136 (l vel 2 Steph.). Mon-
asterio autem de Kirkham dedit jus

dates within the brackets appear to
be in Richard Gascoigne’s hand-
writing. An entry with his signa-
ture is found on the third of the

³ Dugdale's notice of Peter de Roos
is—“ He wedded Adeline, one of the
sisters and coheirs of the famous
Walter Espec, founder of the Abbey
of Rievaulx, in which monastery he
had sepulture, and left issue Robert.’'
And in consistency with this state-
ment the present Genealogy men-
tions only Robert as the issue of
