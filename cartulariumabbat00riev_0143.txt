street, the via strata) to convey the
idea of the ‘ way gone,' and ‘⁶ bar''
(the modern yate), that of the ob-
structing, stopping, barring the ‘way
gone.' Taking sperragata, Sper-
gate, then, as implying the fact that
it was a recognised road or highway,
and connecting it with what follows,
we are thrown upon the conclusion
that, as crossing the Rye under
the given conditions, it must have
crossed it, practically, at or near the
spot now occupied by Rievaulx
Bridge. The boundary line, start-
ing from this point, and running so
as to include, of course, Griff, with
its four carucates, and Thilleston—
which I identify with the present
Stiltons—-with its five, would run
along the wood at the foot of the
hill surmounted by the farm now
called Abbot's Hagg (and called so
because of this very wood) through
Quarry Bank XVood, to where the—
as it may be called—accommodation
road from the farm called Griff falls
into the road leading thence to Sprox—
ton Mi113 from which line, at some
point undefined, and now undefinable,
it would take its course, in a more
or less northerly direction, to the
confluence of two stoeams, one run-
ning through Deepdale, and the other
called Littlebec, but now, as it would
seem, differently named. But we
must leave this part of the ‘ ‘ divisae '³
for the present.

¹ W'e have, in connection with this
name, to remark that the present
line of boundary is dependent on
water from the point at which
Spergate crosses the Rye,—‘ ⁶ omnem
aquam usque ad Fangadale.’' We
have then to follow the course of the
Rye from—if the assumption as to
the locality of Spergate is well
founded—at or near Rievaulx Bridge,
to the point at which the Sef or
Seph falls into it, and thence the
course of the said stream, in order to
satisfy the conditions of the descrip-
tion of boundary as it proceeds : for
our ultimate destination on this side
is “ aqua quae currit per Bildesdala.’'

P.

and that almost certainly designates
what is now called Bilsdale Beck,
and is, one may say, the most import-
ant tributary to the Seph. Follow-
ing the track thus indicated, we find
a modern Fangdale Beck a very
little more than a mile south of the
junction of the Ledge Beck with
Bilsdale Beck. XVhen Fangdale is
reached, it will be observed that the
boundary line deviates from that of
the water-courses it has hitherto fol-
lowed. In other words, it turns to
the west along, or through, Fanga-
dale, but still along a perfectly
definite line—“sicut divisae sunt
inter me et Steinton.'' This will be
better dealt with in the note next
in order.

² It would appear that this local
designation or place-name has faded
not only out of use but out of recol-
lection, there being, so far as the
Ordnance Maps are concerned, no
verbal or suggestive trace of it left.
This is remarkable, inasmuch as it
denoted a district or subdivision of
West Bilsdale which admitted of the
following precise delineation, ‘ ‘ totam
steintunam . . . sicut rivus de
Widhem's descendit per vallem de
Laddedale, et cadit in Riam, et si-
cut Ria vadit deorsum et cadit in
Sef, et sicut Sef vadit usquc Fange-
dala, et sicut vallis de Fangedala
vadit sursum ad Widheris.‘’ Now
Laddedale Beck survives under the
phonetically corrupted form Ladhill
Beck—a corruption quite possibly
due to the too often brilliant emen-
dations originating with the officials
responsible for the nomenclature
adopted in the Ordnance Survey—
which duly runs into the Rye, as also
the Rye is duly joined by the Seph
a little below. Thus, then, Stein-
ton is bounded on the west by the
Laddale Beck3 then on the south-
west and south by the Rye ; on the
east by the Sef3 and on the north
by Fangdale, including, however, it
may be, a section of the latter.

³ This name, otherwise spelt Wid-
heris or VVideris, probably, οι· rather
without doubt, survives in the mo-
dern name lVeatherHouse, which is
