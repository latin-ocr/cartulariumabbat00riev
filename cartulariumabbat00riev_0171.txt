² The note originally appended
here was :—“It is not possible to
identify this locahty, whatever it
may have been; and the same, it

degree, on the privileges conceded
111 the present deed. The simple
fact that the existing boundaries of
the township of Rievaulx in the

would seem, must be said of the
‘insula’ mentioned just below.”
But, since that was written, having
had the advantage of personal in-
spection and inquiry-making on the
spot, Ι 3111 111 3 position to qualify
all that, if not, indeed, to withdraw
the statement altogether. I have
now no doubt whatever as to what,
and where, this “guteria '' was, nor
as to what the word “insula '² in
question really denoted, or to where
its precise position was to be found.
Ι have tried to deal with the subject
more fully and exactly in the Intro-
duction than it would have been
possible to do in a mere footnote,
and it must suffice here to say that
the “ guteria⁷' was, in point of fact,
a private canal, engineered and con-
structed by the monks themselves,
and that its effectual existence de-
pended‚ in no slight measure or

parts referred to in the document
before us are not, in more places
than one, decided by the course of
the river Rye, but deviate from it,
and, so to speak, encroach upon the
lands on the opposite side of the
stream, is in itself amply sufficient
to stamp this deed as 0110 of extra-
ordinary interest, as supplying an
intelligible explanation of the very
abnormal circumstance just referred
to. In the fewest words possible,
the effectual existence of the “gu-
teria” itself actually created the
effectual existence of the‘ ‘insula'’ ;
for from the moment the water
filled the channel prepared for it,
the tract of level land between it
and the river became de sacto an
island—the name it still, in one part,
retains.
