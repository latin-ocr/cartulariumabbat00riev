lxxxvi INTRODUCTmN.

Dugdale and Burton, comprises thirty-one Abbots, who
are indicated in the subjoined list by the Roman
numerals in the second column. The numerals (Arabic)
in the first column indicate the number of the Abbots
who may be regarded as having actually presided over
the affairs of the Convent, and the succession in which
they came. Three names in the list, it will be observed,
are printed in italics. The first of these, VValtheof,
has 110 number of either kind prefixed to the name ; for

could havepossibly existed at the time alleged. It may

of thirty-two Abbots, the explanation being that after
No. XXI. in the accepted list (William v. in our list) he
inserts the name of William de Langton, No. 23 in our
list, but (equally With his predecessor, John Ι.) omitted
by Dugdale and Burton. Thus it will be seen that,
even allowing for the exclusion of VValbran's Abbot
Waltheof, and the two who stand fourth and fifth in
the accepted catalogues, the total number of thirty-six
authenticated Abbots still remains. At least, if there
