et ita, scil, sicut Μ1ε1510111 tendit de Alvestainbech usque
ad divisas inter Theokemarescum et Thornetun, et inde per
ipsas divisas inter Theokesmarescum et Thornetun usque
in Midsich, ita quod totum territorium de Theokemaresco
clauditur 111 wasto, et inde per Midsich 2 usque [123] in Kip-

said stream until it reaches the drain
or slow stream called Kiptoftsich,
the course of which it follows until
it reaches another like drain called
Midsich, which drain again soon
finds its way into Thornton Beck.
This last feature enables us to
identify the Midsich of the boundary
as the Midsyke Drain of to-day,
which lies something less than two
miles nearly due south of Pickering.
And this is a feature which probably
enables us to identify the Kiptoft-
sich of the divisa; for there is a
Toft Drain as well as a. Toft-Swang
Drain communicating with Midsyke
towards the west, and reaching close
to the Costa on the east. It may
, not be possible to decide whether
the one or other of these “ drains ’'
may represent the old Kiptoftsich;
but there can be little doubt that the
modern Wintofts is the survival of
the ancient Kiptofts, and that the
boundary we are pursuing took its
turn to the east in its close vicinity.
Arrived at Thornton-beck, it will be
noted that the boundary-line turns
up the course of the stream, or to-
wards the north, continuing in that
direct-ion until it strikes the dike or
bank which encloses the Theokc-
mersc “campus.’' This name The-
okemersc or Theokemarais is lost.
But from the present document we
find that Thornton and Theokemar-
escus were conterminous: and, by
inference from No. CLXIII„ that, in
part at least, the latter abutted upon
Wilton ; and hence the deduction is
that the lost Theokemersc may be
found again in what is now called
Thornton Marshes, But it becomes
necessary, here, to draw attention to
the fact that there are clearly two
slow drains or sykes involved in the
present delineation, both called Mid-
sich‚ the one of them flowing into
Thornton Beck, the other into Allers-
ton Beck. With this latter we are
no further concerned here, than as
far as its connection with Theoke-

merse is concerned. The next mere
01· boundary-mark mentioned is
Blasta, of which no trace seems to
be left. I should guess it to have
been not far from the angle formed
by the incidence of the modern Carr
Drain, flowing between Thornton
and wilton, with the “ F riar Dike,'’
which is the northern boundary of
Loft Marshes, and literally “ de-
scendit 111 Alvestainebech.'' And,
following this stream to the point of
its confluence with the Derwent, we
reach the place from which the
boundary started. But there is
still one matter remaining to be
noticed, and that is the exception
madessin No. ccx. in the words
“praeter pratum de Eduiemersc.'’
The following extract from No. cxc„
or William de Vesci‘s charter “de
XVastoss’ gives the necessary explan-
ation, and, besides that, leads on to
an approximate identification of
Eduiemersc : “ Ex occidentali parte
rivuli qui de Derewenta se extendit
versus Pickaringam, dedi eisdem
monachis quicquid habui inter Cost-
am et Riam et Kyptoftesich et prae-
fatum rivulum . . . praeter pratum
quod vocatur Eduiemersch, quod
certis divisis coram me a liberis
hominibus meis, cum praedictis mon-
achis, discriminatum est— salvo ponte
et via 1nea,'' this same bridge being
described in No. CXCII. as Pons de
Houm, and known as Howe Bridge
to this day; the rivulet which
“directs itself towards Pickering⁷'
being, beyond question, what is now
called the Tramper Sewer. In this
vicinity, then, Eduiemersch has to
be looked for, as regards its local
habitation.

¹ This is the western Midsich ; the
name lost.

2 This is the Midsich, now Mid-
syke, to the west of Thornton Beck.
It may be observed that in this case
the boundary given proceeds the
other way about.
