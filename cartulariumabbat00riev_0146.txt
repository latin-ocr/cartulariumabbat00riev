For theia is a roadway leading over
Skiplam Moor in a north-westerly
direction, passing close by Wither
Cote, which, for a mile and a half to
two miles from that point, is called
Aldergate, and then onwards Roll-
gate. This roadway, old enough to
have the old North-English term
‘⁶ gate ” applied to it, is continuous
with the probable “via de Thur-
chilesti‚'’ from which comes the
“ magna via⁷' crossing Tripsdale, as
noted above. From the Tripsdale
vicinity this road passes on to the
foot of Hasty Bank, where it is
joined by the direct road past Chop
Yat through Bilsdale to Helmsley‚
both being nierged in the high-road
through Broughton to Stokesley.
From Skiplam Moor, in the other
direction, this old road proceeds past
Skiplam into the high road leading to
Kirkby Moorside, and there can hardly
be any doubt that the Turchilesti of
this document is simply the name of
the ancient tracked route from Kirk-
by Moorside into Cleveland 3 a con-
clusion which derives no little force
from the fact that in No. LV. the
vicinity of a part of the divisa of
WVelburn to Turchilsti is distinctly
adverted to.

1 The ,identification of this stream
has already been noted. The modern
Williamsbeck leaves no doubt on the
sub'ect.

among the Testes, and he is described
as one of Walter Espec's “ homines ’³

John Engelram’s sub-see *on the
south, dividing it from what Espec
retained in his own hands, is clear
enough. But in what sense the
sentence ‘⁴ quantum meae divisae ten-

duntur versus Cliveland supra clivum
montis ” is to be understood is not
too abundantly clear. The expression
in No. V. ‚ wherein Nicholas dc Traili
delivers what he had heard Walter
Espec himself say, namely, “quod
super clivum montis versus Cliveland
totum planum suum erat, quod post·
modum dedit Rievalli, et opertum
bosco subterius totum erat J ohannis
Engleram usque in Willelmesbec,'⁷
seems more intelligible, if it does
not imply too much. Casting one’s
eye over the map, one sees the Cleve—
land Hills are closely concerned with
the boundary of Bilsdale from the
point at which the said boundary
leaves the division between Hawnby
pai-ish and proceeds between Bilsdale
and XVhorlton first, and after that
between it and Carlton, Kirkby, and
Ingleby Greenhow. According to
the apparent sense of the sentences
under notice, all the high moorland
area comprised under the names of
Bilsdale West M oor, Cringley Moor,
and Urra Moor (inclusive of the
Hasty Bank section) is not only in
Walter Espec⁷s hands to give to
Rievaulx, but is actually so given:
John Engleram's sub-see beinglimit-
ed to the inland portion north of
VVilliamsbeck and within the line
of the steep moor-banks—banks not
susceptible of cultivation, either
now or then, by reason of their
steepness, rockiness, or, at least,
general rnggedness. This may be
so, and that it was so eventually
there can be but little doubt. The
Charter by which Robert de Ros
conveyed Raisdale to the Abbey does
not appear to be extant, or some
explanation much to the point might
be obtained. But it is to be ob-
served that Raisdale is one of the
places mentioned above (No. lv.) in
which the Abbot had right of warren
and chace. More light may perhaps
be thrown upon the subject in the
sequel.
