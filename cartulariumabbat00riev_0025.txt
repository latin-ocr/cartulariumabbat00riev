INTRODUCTION. xxi

et omnia quae habui inter boscum et aquam, 613 pisca—
tionem de aqua de Kircham et de Husum.” ¹ If, then,
we accept the usually received and accredited dates of
the several foundations of the one house and the other
—namely, 1122 for that of Kirkham, and 1131, 1132,
or 1133 ² for that of RievaulX—and, so far as appears,
there is no valid reason, if any at all, alleged for reject-
ing them, it is absolutely clear that this so-called Foun-
dation Charter is from ten to twelve or fourteen years,
at the least, later than the actual foundation of the
Priory itself.

But it will be well to show that the allegation, that
the cliarter under special notice is the later of the two,
does not rest upon a mere ipse dixit. There is no
question, I think, that at the dissolution the Priory of
Kirkham was de facto owner of Kirkham in its entirety,
that the whole township³ of that name was in the
hands of the monastery. In No. CCXVI„ however,
Walter Espec grants as follows z——“Ecclesiam (16 Kir—
cham, cum una carucata terrae, et omnibus eidem
ecclesiae pertinentibus; . . . et in Kircham viginti
quatuor acras terrae quae sunt inter boscum et aquam
de Derewenta, et meum novum gardinum, et mansuram
quam Radulfus Presbyter ibi habuit. Etiam proprii

porci canonicorum ibunt in boscum meum de Kircham

¹ I have quoted this in full, be-
cause there are other things in the
passage besides the means it gives
us of fixing the date of the charter
as absolutely later than the founda-
tion of Rievaulx, and which will
have to be thought of in the sequel.

² Each of these three years is
named as the year of the foundation

in question, and possibly 311 ex-
planation of the apparent discrep-
ancy may be found when we come
to deal more specially with that par-
ticular question.

³ The Domesday entry is “In
Chercam, vln carucatae ad gelduni
. . . Ecclesia et presbiter ibi cst.'‘
