1 Unless this be the bran eliminated
from the meal previously to working
it into bread, it is difficult 10 sur-
mise what it is that is intended here.
It may, however—and it would be
more consonant with the apparent
connection of the word—mean por-
tions of over-baked or burnt bread.

2 Again aperplexing word. Just as
braumze may mean the over-baked or
burnt portions of the loaves, so oven-
stoppings may mean the refuse left
in 1115 oven after the bread 15 drawn.

³ This again is 3 word the con-
nection of which it 15 1101 easy 10

pig, female in sex, is sufficiently
apparent. Breeding spefflings, year-
ling speldings, and half-year-old
speldings are all specified in 1115
memorandum under notice. Or, 10
put it- otherwise, spelding seems to
have exactly the same meaning and
application as our North-Country
word gilt, which is applied to 3.
female pig up 10 1115 time 5115 becomes

⁴ “Charlc. Small beer, Yorks.”—-
Halliwell. He also gives the Lino.
verb 10 “ clzark, 10 expose new ale
to the air in an open vessel until it
acquires a degree of acidity, and
therewith becomes clearer and sourer,
fit for drinking.'’ But it is evident
that the word here means the small
beer, the last and weakest mash
from the malt.

⁵ Until they be.

⁶ This probably means the enclos-
ing fences. But inasmuch as ἤθελ’
15 311 alternative form of hedge—cf.
the word heckberry—and besides has
the two meanings of a half-door and 3
wattled or sparred frame, it is possible
that the means of closing the swyne-
howse at pleasure may be intended.

⁷ The customary form of the word
thatch still 111 use here is thack.

3 The collocation of these two
terms calls for a word of comment.
Skeat explains the verb “to geld''
by “to emasculate‚'' and of course
correctly. But “to lib '³ is with
equal correctness defined by the
words “to castrate.” But the col-
location of the words in the present
place forbids the assumption that
they are identical in meaning. Pro-
bably Halliwell's remark that “ to
geld’' was “formerly used for the
operation by which females are ren-
dered barren‚’' conveys the explana-
tion required. The words “cow-
gelder '' and “ sow-gelder ’' will both
be familiar to most of us 3 and the
libbing of pigs is heard of still in
North-country places. Spay, other-
wise splay, is another word for the
‘gffistffloffitffiffl ..11ῗέῙὲἶὲῗέιὶ
ing speldings,’‘ it might have been
suggested that speldings was but 3
form of spaidlings.
