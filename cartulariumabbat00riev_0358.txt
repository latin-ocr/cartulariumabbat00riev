full name is supplied from No.

1 No. cxv111. is a char-ter by the
same Grantor, conveying a donation
of thirty-three acres in the same
vill of Normanby, and also with
the assent of his two sons, who are
likewise named in the present deed.
The first named and presumably
elder of these two sons, Roger, Ι
take to be identical with the Roget·
Host, a grant iu Normanby by
whom is confirmed in the deed
given below. The presence or sup-
pression of an “l” makes an apparent,
without creating a real, difference.
As a case in point, take the name
De Estures (Whitby Chart., No.
cxxvu.), which is certainly the same
name with del Estre or del Hestre,
and which is sometimes met with in
the form Lestre. The clement estre
is represented by Halliwell’s astre, a
hearth, and in the Furness Coucher
astrum stands for a mediaeval iron-
furnace, so that del estre, incorrectly
de estre, signifies simply “of the
hearth or furnace. ” Assuming, then,
the identity of the names Lost and
Host, Ι append here a copy of an
ofiAgjlnal cssartssr in Ygrlz 1liv-luseum :—

2 Two measures of considerable
interest are specified here, the one,
of the contents or area of a bovate,
and the other, of the length of the
perticata or perch. In the district of
Cleveland only the area of the bovate
varied between a minimum of 8 acres,
and a maximum of 20. At least, that
is so, as far as my present informa-
tion extends. The general rule
seems to have been that where the
land was very heavy or ‘stiffi’
there the extent of the bovate was
small 3 where light, or easily ploughed
and cultivated, the acreage was large
ffisffffssssssrssssiss}y‚ ffatssgrffltossfflhossg
upon the year 1299, some seven or
{Lgffialssssrsshgsssse{fuffissgmssssssaisn{³335
ing of the whole being two entries of
the sort connected with the small
vill of Ingleby Barwick, in one of
which a low acreage is given, and in
the other a measurement of one-
third larger. On inquiry from a
land-agent who had the management
of an estate involving the land in
question, I ascertained that in one
part of the township named, two
horses, to use his own words, “ could
easily do the work of three in the
other part.’' The variation of the
length of the perticata was not so
great, but seems to have been more
arbitrary. The two customary
lengths seem to have been 18 feet,
and 20 feet, and they were some-
times designated by the name of the
place in which they were used.
Thus, the perticate of Pickering is
named in the Whitby Chartulary.
