whether apsidal or not, before the early N orman work ¹
we see in the lower parts of the transepts could possibly
have been put together. And as we raise our eyes from
those lower and earlier courses to those which are super-
incumbent, another thought besides that of the difference
of date, betokened by the difference in style, suggests
itself to our deliberate consideration :
strikingly evident, rather than simply apparent, dif-
ference between the building-stone towards the base
and the building-stone in the higher courses. And the
next thought naturally is that the several portions of the

tower. . . . On the south side there
is a wooden porch.” Remembering
the application of the word, in old
days and even yet, to denote beams,
squared trees even, long logs, and
allowing for the possibility of a
clerical error in the form “spuor‚'’
—the forms were divers: sparre,
sper, Old E. sperro, O. N. sparri,
etc.,—there is at least a connection
suggested for the word, and the
application proposed accommodates
itself to our intelligence as much as
the meaning ‘⁶ hewn stone or ashlar ⁷³
sets us upon doubting and question-
ing. One other remark, not alto-
gether irrelevant, may be made, and
that in the way of drawing atten-
tion to an entry—one among others
like—in Domesday, in which the
existence of a ehurch built of wood
in the close vicinity of Rievauhr, is
attested as actually standing at the
time of the survey: “In Beyelcmcl

1 Professor Freeman (English
Towns ancl Districts, p. 311), speaking
of Walter Espec's “Abbey of Rie-
vaux‚’' says that there “ in the tran-
septs the work of the founder himself
remains, ingeniously preserved and
adapted in the enlargement of the
building in the next century.”
Doubtless the choir assumed in the
text was, in the same sense, ‘⁶ pre-
served and adapted,'' by the work
spoken of by the historian as “the
work of the founder himself.'' It
may, perhaps, be a question whether
the great writer here quoted in-
tended these words to bear the full
and considered meaning I have
sought to convey on the preceding
paragraphs of this Introduction, but
the measure of coincidence between
the view I have taken and this
expression of Dr. Freeman's is at
least worth a passing note. It had
escaped my notice until a day or two
