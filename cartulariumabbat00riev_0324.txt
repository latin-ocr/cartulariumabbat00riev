malium occupant, unde i[i]dem fratres in hac parte se plurimum
gravari queruntur. Quocirca, praesentium vobis auctoritate
mandamus quatinus, partibus ante vestram praesentiam con-
vocatis, praefatos Canonicos—scil., de Maltun et de Sempling-
aham-sollicite monere1 curetis, et si necesse fuerit districte
compellere, ut memoratis fratribus super praescripto vasto et
terra nullam molestiam inferant, vel gravamen, set ipsos ea
libere possidere permittant. Veruntamen, si quid juris in
eis se habere confidunt, inde eisdem fratribus coram vobis
ordine judiciario experiantur, et vos causam audiatis, et, causa
audita, concordia vel judicio terminetis. Canonici quoque de
Kirkaham ex nostra parte inhibeatis ne praescripta pascua
ultra rationabilem et antiquam consuetudinem2 occupent, set
suo jure contenti sint, et quod ad memoratos fratres exinde
pertinet eis pacifice possidere permittant, ita quod i[i]dem
fratres non habeant adversus eos materiem querelandi. Data
Anagniae ii Idus Martii.3

case of the seeular inhabitants of any
given locality was provided for by
the local Court of the Manor or
vill 3 and, almost invariably, the
said Court was a Byrlaw Court.
One of the duties of the Byrlawmen,
as the duly constituted officials were
called, was to see that no “com-
moner” put more than his proper
proportion of stock to pasture on
the common pasturing grounds.

disputed case was to be settled
“secundum Birelage,'' and without
recourse to the ordinary Courts of
Law. In the present instance the
dispute is between two convents,
and is referred accordingly.
