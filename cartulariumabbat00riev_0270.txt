CXCVIII. CXXXIX.3 Hemicus Rex Angliae et Dux N orman-
niae . . . Sciatis 1116 recepisse in mea propria manu et custodia
et protectione Domum de Rievalle, et monachos, et omnes
fratres in ea Deo servientes, et omnes terras et res et posses-
siones eorum sicut meam propriam elemosinam. Et volo et
firmiter praecipio quod omnes terras et tenuras suas habeant 61
teneant in perpetuum, et libere et quiete et honorifice et integre,
cum omnibus libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus et quiet-
anciis suis in boscd solutas et quietas de sciris et hundredis
et wapentachiis et placitis et querelis et geldis et Danegeldis
et themantale et auxiliis et [129b] scutagiis et assisis et exerciti-
bus et occasionibus‚et omni terreno servitio et saeeulari exactione:
Et in boscis eorum nullus habeat forestam vel fuget sine
licentia et voluntate eorum, superv forisfacturam meam: sed

the Oxfordshire Dorchester, the
cnrions fate of being at different
times the seat of two distinct bishop-

Bishops were often spoken of as
Bishops of Chester‚ and St. John’s
kept up a kind of vague claim to be

ricks. At the time of the local con-
quest in 1170, Chester contained no
monastic house 3 like Shrewsbury, it
was a stronghold of the seculars, who
possessed two important eburones,
one within and the other without
the walls. within the city was the
church of St. 1Verburh, from which
the first Nornian Earl Hugh removed
the secular canons, rebuilt the churcli,
and turned it into a Benedictine
Abbey. A little before this, Peter,
the first Norinan Bishop of Lichfield,
following the same policy as Remi-
gius at Dorchester and John of Tours
at Wells, removed the seat of his
bishoprick from little Lichfield to
greater Chester. He fixed his throne
in the minster of St. John without
the walls. . . . The stately Norman
work which still remains in the
church is most likely due to this
bishop. For his successor, Robert
of Limesay, moved his throne again
from St. John's to Earl Leofric’s
minster at Coventry. Still the

looked on as a third cathedra] church
alongside of Coventry and Lichfield.‘'

1 There was no Bishop of Roches-
ter at the date required, whose initial
was R. As Hugh Pudsey‚ the
second witness to this Confirmation,
was elected in 1152-3, and Bishop
Walter of Chester died in 1159, 1116
date of the document lies between
those two years But, according to
Le Neve, Walter, brother of Arch-
bishop Theobald, was elected Bishop
of Bochester in 1147-8, and did not
(lie until July 1182. We have there-
fore the alternative of supposing that
the Rievaulx scribe had miscopied
the initial R, or else that Le Neve's
authority, Chron. Gervasz'i‚ was in
error. The last hypothesis can
hardly be maintained.

² John succeeded Hugh Pudsey,
on his elevation to the See of Dur-
ham, in this dignity in 1154, and
retained it till 1163.

3 The numbering is resumed at
this point.
