31. JOHN 111.—“5 April, 1449,’' stands prefixed to this
Abbot's name in Mon. Ebor„ and with the same reference to
Kemp's Register as in the case of his predecessor, which we

have just noticed. His persona] name was Inkeley,1ngelay
(in Gill’s Vallis Eborac), or Inghelay.

32. WILLIAM X1.—In No. 101, which is au extract from the
Close Rolls, temp. Edward IV„ and which bears date J uly 31,
1471, William Spenser 13 distinctly named as the then Abbot
of Rievaulx, and as assigning to John, Lord Scrope of Bolton,
William, Lord Hastynges, and others, West Newton Grange,
etc. The Abbot’s name is mentioned in full in two placeS,
and the document is precisely dated, as already named, so
that there can be 110 doubt as to the fact, either as to name or
time. And as Archbishop Kemp's Register is equally precise,
it is abundantly clear that Abbot John Inghelay intervened
between two Abbots, each of whom bore the same name. Of
course, as the first of these vacated the Abbot's chair by
resignation, the suggestion that the two Abbots Spenser were
in reality one and the same person—the former Abbot having
been re-elected on Inghelay's removal—may be made. But
the supposition involves the improbability, as it will appear to
many, that the man who had become Abbot by or before the
year 1436 should have been so tenacious of life and vigour as
to be able to endure the toils and anxieties of the abbatial
position down to the year 1489 (or, from first to last, up-
wards of fifty-three years), when Abbot Bul-ton assumed the
government of the Convent. The last absolute mention of
this Abbot occurs in 1487, on the 7 th November, in which
year he granted the lease numbered 880, involving the Con-
ventual property in Teesdale.

33. JOHN 111-131111οΠ assigns the date 29th January, 1489,
to this Abbot, naming him John Burton, and quoting Arch-
bishop Rotherham's Register, p. 63, as authority. In Con-
ventual Leases, No. 897, he is mentioned as granting a lease
of lands in Harlsey to Prior Henry Egglyston (or Eccleston)
of Mount Grace, and 111 No. 898 the date named is 1509.

34. VVILLIAM X11.—In the Moozasticon William Helmesley
is given as the thirtieth Abbot, with the date 16th November,
1513, and a reference to the Register of Archbishop Bainbridge.
In Conventual Leases, No. 895, dated 26th March 1526, 110
grants a certain corrody, the particulare of which are of some
interest, having previously in 1524, according to No. 892,
