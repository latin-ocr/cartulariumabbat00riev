the place in which Oswaldenges is
to be looked for.

³ See note ¹. The general 60116111-
sion from all above advanced is that
Oswaldenges occupied the angle of
land between the course of the Rye

bounds described.

⁴ No Radulfus, Dean of York‚ is
recorded by Le Neve; and it has
been already noted that but two
dates for 1116 two Deans named
Robert are given—the one 1148, and
the other 1186. Further, it is
definitely stated that John became
treasurer in 1154, and was conse-
crated Bishop of Poictiers in 1163.
It is, therefore, safer to let Radulfus
stand than to “correct ’' it by sub-
stituting Robert. The implication
may be verified some day.

5 There 6611 be no doubt that this
name is correctly written, inasmuch
as it appears in the same form iu the
heading as it does in the deed itself.
Still, it is the name of 6 11111, and
necessarily, from the particulars
mentioned, identica] with what is
now called Brockhill. (See note ³ to
Lxxw.)
