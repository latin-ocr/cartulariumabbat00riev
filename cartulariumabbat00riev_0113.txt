INTRODUCTION. ciii

granted a lease of lands in Pickering Marrishes to Robert
Hunter. In No. 873, 11111311 of which is illegible, he is recorded
as having leased to William, Prior of Bridlington, certain lands
called Campe and Twillynge, otherwise Twyndill.

35. EDWARD.—This Abbot's name is not mentioned by Bur-
ton, and therefore by 110113 of his copyists. His name is found,
together with that of Brian Higdon, appended to the Status
Monasterii de Fontibus, printed in Mmorials of metains, at
p. 288 ct seq. 3 and 111 1113 11013 011 p. 296, Mr. WValbran states
that he had not been able to ascertain how long or when the
Abbot Edward presided.'' He is, however, repeatedly named
in the Conventual Leases, beginning with N 0. 872², which is
dated 20th January, 1530. No. 889 13 another lease by the
same Abbot, granted in 1531. N 0. 896 13 3 grant by him to one
George Coottes of the office of Conventual swineherd, dated
in 1532 ; and No. 883, dated May 24, 1503, 13 3 13333 granted by
him 01 1311(1 111 1113 Marrishes. But there is much more than this
to be said touching this Abbot, this being, perhaps, the most
appropriate place for taking up a subject which, as I think it
will be seen, connects 113311 111031 closely with him, standing,
as he does, the thirty-fifth in our list. Ι hardly need ad—
vert to the current tradition—for at present, in some of its
aspects‚ it 13 little more—that an Abbot of Rievaulx, no name
being specified, was concerned in the Pilgrimage of Gracc, and
was in consequence executed for high treason. As 311 instance
01 1113 way in which this matter 13 dealt with by those who
compile what they call “ history '' of what is styled the “ local''
sort, without taking the slightest trouble about authenticating
the statements they make or repeat, I quote the following from
Gill’s Vallis Eboraoensis, p. 312: “In 1536 an insurrection
broke out in the northern counties, which was headed by the
Archbishop of York and several of 1113 nobles. This move-
ment was called the ‘ Pilgrimage of Grace‚' the banners of the
insurgents being painted with the image of Christ crucified,
and the chalice and host, the emblems 01 111311 saith. The
rebellion, though somewhat formidable, was soon put down3
and the leaders of the insurgents, among whom was the Abbot
of Rievaulx, were apprehendet] and executed for high treason.’'
The insurrection in question took place early in 1537, when
Rowland Blyton, who lived to surrender the Abbey in the follow-
ing year, was Abbot. Gill's statement is therefore a manifest 11113-
statement. I think also that the same may be said about the
alleged leadership of the alleged Abbot of Rievaulx. But let
that pass. That there was an Abbot of Rievaulx condemned
