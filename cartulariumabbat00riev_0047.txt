to certainty, that Sproxton, Harum, Stonegrave (or at
least parts of the vills so named), and the lands held
by the Surdevals, Lenveisets, Luvels, and others, his
“homines,” mentioned in this charter 01 endowment, 01,
111016 casually, in other deeds, were certainly appende-ges
of his great fies. But even 111 saying as much as this,
elements 01 uncertainty are already introduced, and our
only resource still left is to try and puzzle out painfully
and doubtingly What may have belonged to him, inasmuch
as we hear of it as a part of the possessions of the heirs
of his sisters, which may possibly, perhaps sometimes
probably, have come to them from their great ancestor

Walter Espec.1

¹ It would scarcely be expedient,
and it is surely unneeessary to
occupy space in a chapter of the pre-
sent kind with an inquiry and investi-
gation 01 1116 11611116 111116 indicated.
But it may not be altogether inad-
missible to advert 111 6 11016 10 601116
01 1116 16611116 01 a very brief and
imperfect attempt of the kind in
question. In as few words as can
be conveniently employed, and in-
clusive 01 1116 number 01 0611106166
specified as extant in the two doubt-
ful places, it may be stated that the
extent of 11161666 111 1116 possession
of Walter Espec in the places in
such parts 01 1116 county of York-
shire as are immediately concerned
by his grants, or by the subfees of
his “ men‚” or the direct inheritance
of his descendants (limiting the
period to the end 01 1116 thirteenth
century), must have reached to 135
earucates at the least. And another
statement that may be ventured
is that, 01 11116 very considerable
area, a very considerable proportion
again had, at the time of the Survey,

been in the hands 01 1116 King him-
self, or of his thanes, or, and most
largely, the Earl 01 Mortain. Thus,
in the vills of Sproxton and Griff
the King held six carucates 3 in
Tilston, Helmsley, and Harum the
King and the Earl held between
them fifteen earucates ; in Kirkham‚
Thixendale, Howsham, Whitwell,
Garton, Stouegrave, Pockley and
Beadlam, the Earl had 110 1666 111611
forty -five 0611106166, while this
enumeration does not include
XVestow, in dependencies of which
the King held six 0611106166, 11 1101
eight, and Bai-thorpe in Ackla1n‚
where the Earl had six carucates
more. And the importance 01 1101
omitting these places in such an
enumeration is seen very distinctly
froin the following entry in Kirkby's
Inquest, p. 71: “ Robertus de Ros
