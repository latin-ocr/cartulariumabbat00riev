two succeeding letters ’' referred to by WValbran, in the “ Calen-
dar of State Papers‚’' Henry VIII„ vol. vi„ and numbered 1408,
with the date 1533 appended. At the end appears the further
note as to date, “ London, sth November '' 3 and it will be seen,
on comparison of the contents of these two letters, one written
in September, and the other in November, that they are en-
tirely consistent with one another, and with the other facts of
the case, one, and the most important of which, as to our in-
quiry, is that Abbot Edward was still Abbot up to the middle
of 1533 (see Conventual LeaseS, p. 352, No. 883). With these
preliminary remarks we may proceed to a more special notice
of the letters given in the Memorials of Fou7ztaz'ns‚ the first of
which opens as follows :—“ Pleasithe it your mastershyp to be
advartesyd that, according unto your commandement, with most
diligence I hawe deliverd your letter, also at tymes most con-
