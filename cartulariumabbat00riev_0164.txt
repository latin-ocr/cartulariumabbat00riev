¹ The difficulties in the way of
identifying the place meant by this
name seem almost insuperable, and
are certainly disheartening. Hutton,
with the distinctive name “ le Hole ’'
attached to it, might seem to suggest
itself ; but on investigation the idea
appears to be quite inadmissible.
Hoveton is mentioned, as was to have
been expected, in Burton; but the
entries found there are not helpsul.
They are—“Hox'eton, or Hotavin
Ridale. Ralph Beler gave this place
A.D. ll5l.—Roger de Mowbray gave
this town. Robert de Stuteville,
for the good of the souls of Robert,
his father, and Erneburgh, his
mother, and Helewise, his own wife,
gave this place between Redfram
and Kirkeby.” Here Hotavin is
evidently misprinted or miscopied,
and, probably, for Hovaton. There
is a chartei· touching grants in
Houeton made by Radulfus Beler‚
which will be found below, numbered
OCXXIX. ‚ but no date is attached to it.
It is really an attestation by Robert,
Dean of York, and the Chapter, that
Rad. Beler had made the grant afore—
said in their presence. Roger de
Mowbray's Charter of Confirmation
is before us now; and Robert (le
Stuteville’s confirmation will be
found in No. cxxx. In the latter
a little is added to the local details
of the present deed; but nothing
tending to throw much light on the
local identity of Houeton. The only
points that can be fixed on as avail-

able for this purpose are that it
was adjoining on some part of the
boundaries of Kirkby Moorside —
being itself, it is to be presumed,
within the parish of Kirkdale; in
another direction on some part of
the boundaries of Fadmoor3 and
elsewhere on the course of the stream
called Redofra or Redover‚ which it
has been proposed to identify with
the Hodge Beck from the point
whereat the said stream ceases to be
called Blawath Beck. Indefinite as
this is, all beyond seems to be
totally uncertain. On the whole, it
will be better to abandon the attempt
to localise Houeton precisely—at all
events for the present.

2 The only name on the map any-
where near the vicinity indicated
that at all assimilates itself to this
name is lVattelmoor. But it is
of no avail for our purpose.

3 There seems to be no clue what-
ever of any tangible description, such
as to lead on to even any hypotheti-
cal identification of either this place,
Balbusch‚ or Aicwath. Robert de
Stuteville's charter adds another un-
identifiable name, and apparently in
the close vicinity to these three,
namely, Jukeleholm. In close se-
quence it mentions also a place just
across the Redofra, connecting with
it a local reference to the north side
of Kirkdale Church. This adds a
little, and but a little, to the assumed
approximate locality of Houetun.
