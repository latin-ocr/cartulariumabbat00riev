² This is a somewhat mysterious
deed, which, with one or two others
pertinent to the same matter, will
be more fully considered in the
Introduction.

² Ejusdem.

3 So far Ι have been unable to
ascertain positively what this term
may imply or what may be its philo-
logical connection. “De alia ma-
teria‚” in the succeeding clause, seems
too indefinite to found any certain
conclusion on ; although it might be
advanced that at that date, brick
not being in use for such purposes,
the only two kinds of material pos-
sible were stone and wood, or pos-
sibly what is termed “post and
p'an‚” or some accommodatiori of it ;
and as we can only imagine stone
would have been the material em-
ployed in the construction of the very
most important buildings of the Con-
ventual Edifice—namely, the Church,
the Chapter-Home, the Dormitory,
and the Refectory—it seems almost
to force upon us (though, I think,

wrongly) the conclusion that by
“ spuor’' may be understood “ash-
lar.” But see Introduction.

4 Shingles nowadays‚ or wooden
substitutes for tiles or slates. Even
to the present day buildings are
roofed with shingles.

⁵ This beyond all question means
rushes, or possibly reeds. Rushes,
locally called ‘seves‚' are in use 10
this day throughout this district, as
thatching material. That they have
been so used from time immemorial
there is no doubt. In the Consuetu-
‹lines Cotariorum de Hakenes, printed
at p. 365 of the Whitby Chartulary,
a part of the services due from each
cotarius was ‘ ‘ coopertorium metere,”
to mow rushes for thatch. Under
the heading Ros, Ducange gives an
extract (lating in 1318 as follows—
“ pour les carpentages quel voudroit
faire aus dites maisons et hosteils,
nous li ‹levons livrer sis milliers de
Ros” (Clzart. ΑΜ). S. Amandi, Reg.
62, ch. 98). The great dorter at
Ely was thatched until 1360.
