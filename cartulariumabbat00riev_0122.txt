Mr. Hope’s note pertinent to the “ Image 01 St. Cristofer 111 0
tabernacle sett between these two chapels '² (p. 336) 18, “It 18 not
clear whether this was in the transept or in the aisle 3 but Ι think
in the transept in front 01 1110 pier, which is somewhat cut about.''

“The western arch 01 1110 south aisle of the choir was screened 3
all three 01 1110 arches on the east side of the north transept were
partitioned off by screens as high as the capitals, as is attested by
the cuts which have been made there 3 and the arch from the south
aisle 01 1110 110νο 11110 1110 transept was filled with a wooden screen.⁷'

Mr. Hope's comment on the uncertain word in the sentence,—
“A place of three shows 01 tymber '² (p. 338)-—is, “was not this a
place 01 ‘three howse high,' that is, three storeys divided into com-
partments for books 2 Perhaps they had a portable ladder instead
01 0 ν100.”

“The ‘dortor' (p. 339) 01 course extended southwards from the
transept over the Chapter-House, etc. As to the ‘ second dortor,'
the site is not quite certain. Probably over the buildings forming
the north side 01 1110 farmery cloister. Or it may have been the
domus necessaria or rere-dorter. 01. 1110 ‘third dorter ' at Canter-
bury. ⁷²

T ouching the Frater and its windows the remark is, “ The
number 01 111080 windows does not agree with what there was, and
actually still is 3 and nothing is said about the great undercroft
below the Frater.''

The Convent kitchen was on the west 01 1110 Frater, as at Foun-
tains, Tintern‚ etc., and had a hatch to pass food through.

As to the “ Garnare on the west 01 1110 0105781οΓ '⁷ (p. 340) : “ The
building usually met with in this position is the great range found
at Fountains, Beauheu, Byland, Kirkstall, etc., assigned to the
conversi. . . . Here they probably used as their dining -hall
the undercroft 01 the Frater. But where did they lodge‘l The
‘ garnare ² 01 Rievaulx is so marrow-less than twenty feet—I
thought it might really be the ‘lane ' found at Citeaux, Clairvaux,
and Pontigny3 and, in England, at Beaulieu, Byland, and Kirk-
81011 3 and originally, as 1 have discovered, at Fountains also 3 but
the windows and doors in the west wall seem to negative the
existence 01 0 ‘cellarium ’ on the west 01 it.⁷'

Mr. Hope thinks that the “ house for evidence ⁷’ was somewhere
near the chapter-house, and as to “the long house between the
hall and the dorter,⁷' he inquires : “ Was this the great rere-dorter.
