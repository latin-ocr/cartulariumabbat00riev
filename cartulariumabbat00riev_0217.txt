¹ This is the first of a series of
charters, numbered consecutively
CXLVA to CXLV-1, all bearing direct
reference to the subject-matter of
the several preceding documents, or
to other lands granted to the Con-
vent in the same vicinity. The
originals belong to Lord Bolton‚ to
whom, for his great courtesy and
kindness in permitting and facilitat-
ing the copying of the same, my very
sineere acknowledgments are due.
Most of the deeds have their seals
still appended, many of them having
two, and far the greater part of the
said seals are in good preservation,
not a few of them being in wonder-
fully good condition. And from the
care bestowed upon them, they are
saie from any harm save that inflicted
by time.

² The Grantor is the second son of
the Grantor of the three Charters
numbered CXXXIX„ ch„ CLXI. He
had four brothers, Roger, the eldest
son (named in Nos. cxxxlx„ exn,
CXLIII„ ete), whose son Roger's
name will be seen in the next ‹leed ;
VVerri‚ Jordan, and Conan being the

other three. Of these the present
Grantor had issue a daughter Ymania,
Ymena, Ysmagina (the name ap-
pearing in other forms also), who
was twice married, but seems to
have died without bearing children,
and a son Conan. Not only is no
reference made to any other descend-
ants of Acharius besides those
already named, but it is an inference
which it seems hard to evade, de-
ducible from this series of documents,
that, with the three grandchildren
just named, the family died out.
Certainly, General Plantagenet Har-
risun, at pp. 300, 301, would make
it seem otherwise. But he has con-
fused Acharius of Tunstal in York-
shire with the family of Tunstal in
Laneashire. He describes Achary
as the giver of “the Grange of Bol-
ton to the Abbot of Rievaulx, ” (lating
the gift in 1132, a date not agreeing
too well with that quoted in No.
cxxxrx., and he then assigns to him
two sons, Alan and Walter, who are
not only not the sons Aeharius him-
self acknowledges in the chartei·
just cited, but belong to the Lanca-
shire family.
