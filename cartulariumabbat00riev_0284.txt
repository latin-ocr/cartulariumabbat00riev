sine secta, et ad xiicim vaccas et duos tauros, cum nutrimento
suo, ad opus pastorum suorum, per omne territorium et per
totam forestam meam de &Vesterdala ubique, longe et prope,
sine retenamento, excepto pratis et bladis, ubi, post ablatam
vesturam, libere utentur pastura sicut homines ejusdem villae,
ita quod vituli et vitulae vaccarum, cum fuerint duorum
annorum, inde removebuntur: et ad praedicta animalia habe-

clausuram, et caetera omnia [aisiamenta] ibi et alibi in pastura

in eadem villa dedi eas duas bovatas terrae plenarie, cum
stauramento, et aliis pertinenciis et aisiamentis, sicut concessi

pasturis pecora eorum metas statutas transierint, sine facta

1 The modern form of this name
is Wooddale beck3 and it is note-
worthy that in another part of the
same district, about six miles dis-
tant north-east, the same mediaeval
name is corrupted into the same
modern form—to be sure, with
diversities of spelling. Ι refer to
XVooddale, near Stonegate, which

in the Brus Partitio is written
Ulvdale.

2 A manifest corruption of Hog-
thwaith or Hogtwaith. Its site may
be determined by that of the farm-
stead known as Thwaites or XVaites
House, near XVooddale House in
Westerdale Head, and about two
miles north of Esklits.

3 The source or origin of the river
Esk. It is close on the boundary
line between Farndale East and
XVesterdale. The termination is
doubtless closely connected with
Welsh lli (in the plural llit) a gush,
flood, stream. The word is found
in more than one place in local

names in this northern district, and
among other instances one is found
not far from Rievaulx itself.

⁴ In addition to the two local
Ulfdales or Wolfdales noticed in a
preceding note, there is, on the
moorland ridge lying between Great
Fryup and Danby, and not more
than three to four miles east of
VVooddale in XVesterdale, a houe or
grave-mound called Wolfpit. In
this there is a large excavation of
a totally different aspect from the
cavities usually found in such hills,
and which are due to the non-
seientific openings made in search
of the supposed valuables contained
in the barrows. The name is cer-
tainly not of modern imposition,
audit is now very many years ago
——I daresay twenty years before
Ι became acquainted with such
sources of information as the present
charter—that in a story Ι wrote for
publication in a Boys’ Magazine I
made this hill the scene of a struggle
with a wolf. Doubtless, it was, in
