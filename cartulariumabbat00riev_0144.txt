18 CARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.

inde supra clivum montis quantum meae divisae tenduntur
versus Clivelandam, et subtus clivum montis a monte qui
vocatur Tranesh0f1 per vallem quae dicitur Landesmere 2 usque
ad aquam quae currit per Bildesdala: hae sunt divisae a parte

occidentis..

met with in the precise vicinity
where it is wanted to suggest such
identffication, inasmuch as it lies
about a mile slightly to the south of
west of Fangdale. Hence, as is
evident on comparing the description
given in the document before us with
the map, the boundary line would
strike across to what is now the
march between Bilsdale and Sniles-
worth Moor in the parish of Arden,
following it, it is likely, to the angle
at which it diverges rather more to
the westward of north, at which
point the very considerable elevation
of 1326 feet is obtained, with a con-
spicuous tumulus on its summit.

1 Whether or no the summit just
named may be the ‘⁵ mons qui voca·
tur Traneshof³³ there is no possi-
bility of deciding. All that can
possibly be said is that the conditions
imposed by the description given
require its presence somewhere in
that vicinity.

2 Again there is an utter absence
of any verbal clue or means of iden-
tifying the locality designated by
this name. The one suggestion as
to the place in which it is to be
looked for lies in the circumstance
that the valley or dale intended runs
towards the water which flows
through Bilsdale, that is, as I take
it, in distinction from the stream
called Raysdale Beck3 and if this
sui-mise is correct, the “ vallis'’
meant is the bed of the small stream
which runs into the Bilsdale water
just below the junction of the Rays-
dale Beck with Bilsdale Beck. And
it may be added that this view ob-
tains strong confirmation from the

fact that it accommodates itself
entirely to the termination of the
boundary on the eastern side as
given just below. A little stream or
beck called VVillelmesbec forms the
said termination, and the now-a-days
Williamsbeck runs into the Bilsdale
water within a few score yards of
what is thus supposed to be Lands-
mere valley or dale.

³ We have previously followed the
course of the eastern boundary line
to the confluence of two streams, the
one running through Deepdale and
the other called Littlebeck. Both
these names appear to have passed
into obscurity; but if we may take
guidance partly froin the particulars
named and partly from the existing
boundary line between the townships
of Rievaulx and Helmsley, we shall
probably not be mistaken in assum-
ing that the water-course running
through the valley with the eastern
division of Ouldray wood on one side
of it will be Littlebeck; and if so,
then that the valley with the other
part of the wood just named clothing
its western bank will be the ancient
Dffipgld‘llllgwing the sike from the head
of what we have taken to be Little-
beck, along which the Rievaulx boun-
dary runs, and almost due north, we
come to a point in the boundary which
seems to afford something approach-
ing to certainty in our endeavours
after identification, namely Raud-
pade, for which see next note.

is utterly meaningless, and, besides,
furnishes 110 apparent clue whatever
to anything in the nature of a deri-
