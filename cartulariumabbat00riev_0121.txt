ADDITIONAL NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ FABRIO
INVENTORY.

BY the kindness of Mr. W. H. St. John Hope, of the Society of
Antiquaries‚ I am permitted to avail myself of certain notes touch-
ing divers entries in the Fabric Inventory printed at p. 334 et seq.

On page 334, touching the entry “The rode loft,'' he writes:
“A great loft stood under the eastern arch of the tower, and high
up above it are the holes for a rood—or candle—beam.⁷'

“The Stallys. The stalls occupied the two western bays of the
eastern arm, and terminated at the fifth pier. Between the fourth
and fifth piers is the aradus chori, and immediately to the west the
‘ upper entrance ' into the choir from the aisles. Behind the
stalls, and extending for five bays from the tower, are clear traces
of the Cistercian longitudinal stone wall, with north and south
choir doors. It probably returned behind the High Altar <which
stood in the third bay), and was, clear of the stalle, arcaded along
its front. In illustration of this, note the bases.''

On pp. 335, 336, are notices of five altars situate at the east end
of the choir, or rather of what would be the east end if the church
had had the usual orientation 3 and with respect to these Mr. St.
John Hope says : “ The pinholes for the reredoses of the five eastern
altars are very plainly seen. The five altars were divided from
each other by perpent walls of stone, nine feet long and one foot
thick, which were continued westwards with timber to meet a great
cross screen or parclose. Each altar stood on a platform one step
high, below which was a small floor drain. A little to the west are
two steps running right across the Church, but clear of the eastern
face of the first pair of piers, and on the top step was the parclose
that extended from one side of the church to the other, and parti-
tioned off the five altars. The parclose was thus also clear of the
piers which have no cuts or marks on them.''

The pinholes for the “ loft of tymber on the baksyde of the high
altar with a sele under it of wood ” still remain in the piers,
