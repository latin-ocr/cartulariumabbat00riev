46 GARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.

trorum, in perpetuum tenere . . . unam partem deserti subtus
Hestechait adjacentis Boltebia‚1 his terminis adsignatam :—
a parte orientali et australi subtus montem sicut Rutendesic2
fluit supra montem sicut via ducit de Mortun3 ad Boltebia,
ita ut quicquid infra eandem viam combinetur in bosco et plano
suum sit de terra de Boltebia per divisas de Stutekelde 4 et de
Mortun: a parte vero aquilonari et occidentali subtus montem
per rivulum qui vocatur Haichovedsic5 usque ad aquam in
valle fluentem, et per eam usque ad locum illum ubi aqua a
proprio cursu extrahitur, et inde ultra aquam ad supercilium
montis, et inde subtus montem sicut clausura descendit ad
aquam ubi Rutendesic eandem aquam intrat. Praeterea concedo
praedictis fratribus in tribus villis meis aisiamenta sua in bosco
et in plano—scil, materiem lignorum et communem pasturam
sicut liberius et quietius habeo ad meum opus proprium.

LXXVII. XXXV. Omnibus . . . Adam de Boltebi, salu-
tem. Sciatis me dedisse . . . Ecclesiae de Rievalle . . . in

Guthalgillesiclie.⁷ Hoc feci concessu Dominae et matris meae,

¹ Little more than an approximate
identification of the area granted by
this charter can be attempted. The
area in question is a portion of the
waste lying below Hesketh, and
between it and Boltby; and this is
the main fact there is to depend
upssxiQIZIZiibeagtetlthetmap will show a
small stream descending from a
height of a thousand feet, as the hill
itself descends, until at a point less
than half a mile south-west of Hes-
keth Grange it takes a turn to the
west, and runs into what is marked as
Lumshaw beck. At no great distance
from the origin of the small stream
just named, another rises and takes
its course to the west, joining the
said Lumshaw beck at a point about
a mile and a half to the north of

that at which the first-named rivulet
runs into it. The first of these may
be the Rutandsyke, and the second
the Oakheadsyke.

³ Now Murton.

4 No trace of this name seems to
present itself.

⁵ See note ⁴2. But it should not be
overlooked that there is a deviation
from the course of the stream named
at one place, and that that deviation
involves contact with an enclosure
belonging (as is to be presumed) to
the monks.

⁵ The orthography of this name is
uncertain. It might be Juronis.
But that is as little familiar as a
personal name as Vironis itself.

⁷ Both locality and origin of the
name are equally obscure.
