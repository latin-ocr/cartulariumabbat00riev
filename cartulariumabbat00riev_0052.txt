credit was thereby bestowed.

But to revert to the subject wc had in hand before
making this digression. Looking, then, upon the first
grant towards the raising and sustentation of the
nascent Abbey as made in 1131, and the actual con-
summation of commenced and direct action as mark-

with the early stages of foundation-work at Fountains,
only a year or two after—left to our own surmises as
to the progress of events in the weeks and months
that followed. With the fairly substantial initiatory
grant of nine earucates of land, and that land in itself
of 110 inferior quality, and with the countenance and,
doubtless, active sympathy of their first founder and
benefactor, we can hardly think of the monkish colony
as experiencing one tithe of the difficulties, and hardly
any of the stern hardships, which fell to the lot of
their brethren on the banks of the Skell. Not that it

neyed passage. Mr. NValbran (Mem.
of Fountains, 2, n. 5) writes, “This
description was naturally suggested
by a passage in the Life of St.
Ber-nard, where it is said of him and

Kirkstead in deseribing the founda-
