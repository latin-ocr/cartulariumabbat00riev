1 “An enclosure, screen, or rail-
ing, such as may be used to . . .
separate a chapel from the main body
01 a church ” (Parker's Glossary of
Architecture). It is hardly necessary
to remark that this screen or par-
close is not to be confounded with
the main screen, occupying its usual
place, or between the practica] choir
and the nave. There is the utmost
certainty that the parclose here
named would cross the “ chaunsell '³
or choir in the rear 01 1116 high altar.

somewhat uncertain. The significa-

gssleigybgses of these five altars

to the meaning 01 1116 contracted
word noted just above so satisfac-
torily certain.

4 No altars are specified here as
having occupied positions in these
two chapels in the south transept.
Still there is no doubt that there
were such altars. And it will be
noted that, on coming to the two
chapels in the north transept, the
altars standing 111 1116111 severally are
