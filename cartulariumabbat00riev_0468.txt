noticed under the form throuh.

² Another indication of the havoc
that had already been made in more
parts than one of the conventual
buildings.

³ One naturally, at first sight,
fixes on the word yrayle as what is
to be understood here: that is to say,
the 9radale or yraduale of the ancient
services, defined by Mr. Way, in his
notes to Pr. Pm. as “a service book
containing the responses, or qradalia,
so called because they are sung in
madibus, or in course.” Skeat, how-
ever, suggests the translation “upon
the steps '' as preferable for in madi-
bus. But whatever the first induce-
ment as to the identity of the word
may be, yet, on pursuing the para-
graph a little further, it is at once
apparent that the word “other’' in

the clause, ‘ ‘ other bretasynges '⁹ bears
reference to this word ⁸(smiles—inas-
much as there is no other word with
which it can be correlated—and that
consequently yralles must be of the
same general nature as bretasinyes, as
to which word see next note. This, of
course, throws us at once upon 9rill,
Fr. mille, a grating, of which Skeat
says that it was formerly spelt yrail
or yre'il. The word is still in use in
French Convents.

⁴ Skeat gives “Brattice, a fence
of boards in a mine,'' with the further
notice :—“ M. E. ‚ bretaye, bretasce,
brutaske (with numerous other spell-
ings), a parapet, battlement, out-
work‚’' ete„ and the following quota-
tion from Pr.Pm.‚ “Becrax, bretasce,
brecays, of a walle, propugynaculum.’'
