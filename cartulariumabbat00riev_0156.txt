30 CARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.
tatem repetendi decimas suas, sicut habuerunt tempore quo
haec conventio facta est, si monachi Rievallenses ab hac con-
ventione resilire voluerint, atque tres marcas pro praedictis
decimis monachis de Dunelmo persolvere annuatim noluerint.
[34] Et quamdiu iii marcas dabunt, decimas illas in pace,
libere et quiete tenebunt.

LV. CARTA GUNDREDAE DE SKIPENUM.

XII.1 Gundoeda, uxor Nigelli de Albaneio, universis filiis
S. Ecclesiae, salutem. Sciatis me dedisse et . . . confirmasse, con—
cessu filii mei, Rogeri de Moubrai, Deo et S. Mariae Rievallis et
fratribus ibidem . . pro anima viri mei Nigelli de Albaneio,
et pro salute animae meze et filii 11161, Rogeri de Molbrai, et uxoris
suae, et filiorum suorum, et pro anima patris et matris meae, et
omnium antecessorum meorum, quicquid 111 dominio meo habui
de culta terra in Skipenum? 61, ubi culta terra deficit versus
aquilonem, quicquid est in feudo meo et filii mei, Rogeri de
Moubrai, in bosco 61 plano, 61 pasturis et wastinis, secundum
divisas inter XVellebruna et Wimbeltun, 61 516111 divisae de
Wellebruna tendunt ad Thurkilesti,3 61 ita versus Clivelandam,
nominatim Locum et Locumeslehit,4 et Wibbe11ahge‚⁵ et Lan-
geran‚5 et Brannesdala, et Middellmved,6 sicut divisae sunt inter
Wellebruna et Faddemor, et ita versus Clivelandam. Haeo
omnia concessi et dedi eis libere et quiete ab omni terreno

¹ So numbered, notwithstanding
the fact that the last document is
numbered x. It should also be noted
that in the original Index [No.
xxxvnI ] there is a blank left after
1116 number XI.

-This name, which appears under
the varying forms, Skipenum, Scip-
num, Scypnome, Schipnum, ete„ is
replaced by the more modern 101111
Skiplam· ‚ and sofar Ι have met with
no intermediate form to show how
the change was effected.

3 See note on p. 19. The occur-
rence of this name in a new locality,
and, it is to be assumed, still nearer
to Kirkby Moorside, is by 110 means
without its special interest, as 6011-
firming the view taken as to its
meaning and application.

⁴² The former clement in this name
appears to have been entirely lost ;
but the terminal -slehit, which in
other (1061111161115, yet to be noticed,
takes the form -slectes 01· -slettes, al-

most certainly, taken in conjunction
with its evident vicinity, identifies
the place intended. Sleights House,
about two miles north-west from
Gilla-moor, no doubt perpetuates the
old Locumslehit 01· Locumslectes.
This word sleiylzcs, or, in its older
form, slectes, is one of frequent
occurrence in place-names, and
usually seems to imply a fairly
smooth-as opposed to overgrown
with brushwood or bushes—place or
lain.
p ⁵ No clue to lead to the identifica-
tion of these places, or more than
their approximate vicinity, has yet
been met with.

⁶ This is Middle Head, the north-
ernmost part of the Farndale moors,
something less than three miles west
of Ralph Cross. Further notes on
the localities concerned in the series
of documents, of which the present
is the firs ‚ will be found on future
pages.
