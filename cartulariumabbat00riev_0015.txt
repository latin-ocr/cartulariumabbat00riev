sequence, and finding “ religious consolation '⁷ in the
founding and endowing of the three monasteries named,
is in any respect one to be depended upon. YVhen
we turn to the second and final so-called Endowment or
Foundation Charter of Kirkham, we find the souls of
the fathers and mothers of the F ounder's nephews men-
tioned, as also those of all their fore-elders and benefac-
tors, and those of all the faithful dead, mentioned, but
no reference to the son of whom he had been bereaved.
Should we examine the corresponding clause of the so-
called Foundation Charter of Rievaulx, what we meet-
with is thought of the salvation of the dead King william,
of the living King Henry, and of all their ancestors 3 of
that of the F ounder's father and mother, of Hugh de
Wildecher, of that of his wife's father and mother, and of
all their fore-elders and ancestors in common, but no
hint even—not even so much as that in the phrase ‘⁴ all
the faithful dead '' in the Kirkham deed—of a lost and
lamented child, grief for whose removal had inspired
and led to both the one foundation and the other.

I know, of course, that this is not a conclusive
consideration, and that, if dwelt upon too much, it
might prove a very broken reed indeed to rest upon.
But what is to me much more conclusive is that in the
earliest and, undoubtedly, most authentic statements¹
relative to Walter Espec we have, no mention is made
of an heir that had been, but was gone, no possible or
even latent suggestion that he had ever been a father.
The account referred to is printed in the Monctsticon
(vi. 209), and is headcd, ‘⁶ E Libello Alredi Rievallensis
Abbatis, de Bello Standardico (Lelandi Collect, vol. ii.
