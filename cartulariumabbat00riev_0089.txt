mislaid my copy of the proceedings in the case ; but as
a truce for two years was made with the Scots at the
end of 1319, and de Meinill died in 1322, it would
seem that the transaction we are noticing must have
antedated the first-named year. Thomas Π. was Abbot
in 1315 3 William V. in 1318.

As touching what is sometimes spoken of as the
battle of Byland‚ and what is alleged or supposed to
have occurred as a sequel thereto, a few words only can
be written. The document which 15 printed in the
Appendix, the last but one in the series, will be seen at
once to be absolutely unconnected with the incident in
question. That document is dated in 1318: the battle
of Byland happened, I believe, in 1322. Already at
the former date, the rava-ges committed by the ScotS‚
almost throughout the North of England, had been
repeated as well as pit-iless ; but in the year last named,
after the defeat and execution of Lancaster, the King
invades Scotland, is baffled in his attempts, his army
reduced in strength by famine, and retreat is forced
upon him. He is greatly harassed in his retreat, and
the Scots make further and fearful raids into North—
umberland and Yorkshire, advancing as far as North—
allerton‚ which town is burnt by them. So far all is
clear. But authorities, or rather, accountS, differ as
to the place at which the King was surprised by the
sudden advance of the foe, while at his dinner. Thus,
Gffl (p. 221) says that Edward “came to Byland
Abbey, and encamped there ; that he was surprised
while at dinncr 3 made 1115 escape from the Abbey with
great haste, crossing the country by way of Bridling
