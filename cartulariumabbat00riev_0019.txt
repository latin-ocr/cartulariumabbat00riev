energy in those wilds of Yorkshire3 the possibilities in
active leaven for good already experimentally known
to be obtainable by mea-ns of a monastic settlement in
the district needing to be influenced for the better and
higher. Let us not forget that there lay a motive, an
object, a purpose, a principle at the very foot of the
great movement of which the founding and raising of
religious houses at the time we have to think of was

but only an outward token or symbol.1

1 Let me here ask attention to
the following sentences, which were
not seen by me, and, indeed, Ι
believe were not published, until
several months after the above para-
graphs had been written, and which,
while (as perhaps might have been
anticipated) ignoring the religious
principle, yet in all other respects
more than indorse the view taken
in the text. They are from Mrs.
Green's Henry the Second, pp.
39, 40·43. . . . “ The restoration
of outward order '⁷—by the young
king, that is—“had not been diffi-
cult. . . . But the new ruler of
England had to begin his work of
administration not only amid the
temporary difficulties of a general
disorganisation, but amid the more
permanent difficulties of a time of
transition, when society was secking
to order itself anew in its passage
from the mediaeval to the modern
world. . . . We 566 everywhere, in
fact, signs of the great contest which
in one form or another runs through
the whole of the twelfth century,
and gives its main interest in our
eyes to the English history of the
time—the struggle between the iron
organisation of mediaeval feudalism
and those nascent forces of modern
civilisation which were fated in the
end to shatter and supersede it. . . .

No doubt it

It is still plain that even through
the terrible years of Stephen's reign
England had its share in the univer-
sal movement by which the squalor
and misery of the Middle Ages were
giving place to a larger activity and
a better order of things. A class un-
known before was fast growing into
power—the middle class of burghers
and traders. . . . Merchant and
cultivator and wool-grower found
better work ready to their hand
than fighting, and the appearance
of mercenary soldiers marked every-
where the development of peaceful
industries. Amid all the confusion
of civil war the industrial activities
of the country had developed with a
bewildering rapidity 3 while knights
and barons led their foreign hire-
lings to mutual slaughter, monks
and canons were raising their re-
ligious houses in all the waste places
of the land, and silently laying the
foundations of English enterprise
and English commerce. To the great
body of the Benedictines and the
Cluniacs were added in the middle
of the twelfth century the Cister-
cians, who founded their houses
among the desolate moorlands of
Yorkshire, in solitary places which
had known no inhabitants since the
Conqueror's ravages, or among the
swamps of Lincolnshire. A hun·
