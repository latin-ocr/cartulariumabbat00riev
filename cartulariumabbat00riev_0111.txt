11016 touching this Abbot, and he gives a reference to Arch-
bishop Kemp's Register, p. 421. The entry there (my note 16
p. 4201)) 16 10 1116 effect that John Inghelay was elected Abbot
of Rievaulx, on the resignation of william Spenser, in 1449.
Τ1116, while on the one hand it verifics the precise date at
which Abbot william ceased (by resignation) to be Abbot,
verifies also the fact that his personal name was Spenser.
This 16 6 circumstance calling for specific remark, for, as will
be noticcd more fully presently, the name of the Abbot who
succeeded John Inkeley or Inghelay was likewise william
Spenser.
