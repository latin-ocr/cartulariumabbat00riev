the foundation of Rievaulx‚ and that is equivalent to
saying that its date is at least ten years—and it might
easily be eleven or twelve years—Subsequent to the
actual or initial ‘⁶ foundation '' of the Priory. Not that
this is a very important matter in itself, or that it has
any great significance in any way. The probability is
