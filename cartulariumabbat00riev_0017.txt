not his other writings to appeal to for confirmation of
our view—as any of his compeers well skilled in the
arts of description. And while, on the one hand, we
draw the inevitable inference that he spoke of a man
childless by no mere casualty, there is, on the other,
the distinct statement that 116 made Christ his heir,
not because he had lost a son, but because he had no
heir after the flesh.1

For the story itself, as usually told, this 16 what
Mr. Walbran (Mem. of Fozmtaz‘ns, ii. 17 8) has to say :—
“ The facts of the incident were first published in the
Monasticon Anylz'canum, from a volume of collectione,
now preserved among the Cotton Mss. in the British
Museum, where it is marked Vitellius, F. 4. It records
with considerable minuteness that, in the reign of King
Henry 1., &Valter L'Espec was the lord of Kirkham and
other large estates in Yorkshire and Northumberland—
1116 rewards of uncommon bravery in 1116 wars of the

period3 and that by Adeline his wife he had an only

son, who bore his father’s Christian name, and was dis-

making mention of WValter Espec’s
action in founding Rievaulx, are to-
tally silent as to any motive of his,
founded on, or springing from, such

occasioned by the loss of an only son.

date ΑΛ). 1131, writes 2-—“ Sane
paulo (ante fundationem Abbathiae
de Fontibus) a nobili viro waltero
Espec invitati, et a felicis memoriae
Bernardo Abbate directi, monachi
clarevallenses in Eboracensem pro-
vinciam venerant, et in loco qui
nunc dicitur Rievallis, tunc autem

locus erat horroris et vastae solitu-
dinis, mansionem acceperant, prae—
fato viro tradente, et Venerabili
Turstino episcopalem, cum affectu
paterno, favorem praebente.’' So
too XValter of Hemingburgh thus
speaks of the “Fundatio Rieval-
lis”:—“Sane paulo ante (funda-
tionem Abbathiae de Fontibus) a
nobili viro VValtero Espec fundata
fuit (lomus Ryevassis, consistente
Thurstino Archiepiscopo, et assen—
sum praebente, ubi Monachi clare-
vallenses, felicis memoriae Abbate
Bel-nardo directi, sempiternam acce-
perunt mansionem. '⁸
