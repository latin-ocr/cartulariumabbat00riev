concessisse Deo et Ecclesiae S. Mariae de Essartis et
monachis . . . qui de Abbatia Rievallis exierunt, ut
ibi abbatiam faciant, totam essartam de Wardona et
de Sudgivela, ct totum illud boscum de illis duabus
villis, per illas divisas et metas quas VValterus Espec,
qui haec eis donavit, illis fecit et statuit.’' On turning
to the Bedfordshire Domesday we find under the head-
ing ‘⁶ XXV. TERRA WILLELMI SPECH,'' and among the
half dozen mauors, with sundry other lands, amounting
in all to more than sixty hides, specified as held in
capite by Spech, the manors of lVardone and Sudgiv-
ele mentioned as comprising, the one of them nine hides
and the other five and half a yardland, together With
a variety of interesting details as to the nature of the
property and its value. But the fact of special interest
is that William Spech, at the date of the return in
question, or 1087, is the feudal occupant of the lands
and rights granted forty-eight years afterwards by
lValter Espec to the nascent monastery of lVardon.
This can scarcely be a fortuitous coincidence ; for there
is the absolute identity of the manors specified ancl the
practica] or defucto identity of the name of the tenant
in capite of 1087 with that of the grantor of 1131.
The inference that lValter Espec was, not simply the
heir, but the son——or at least the nephew on thc father's
side—of William Spech is unavoidable, for anything
we can see to the contrary. And there is no apparent
reason for not accepting the infercnce that he was son
rather than nephew, and this decides the form of the
name.

But this is a conclusion Which, so far as it is valid,
