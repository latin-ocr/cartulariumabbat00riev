xxxiv INTRODUGTION.

tion raised by this consideration, but one explanation of
the views and intentions so distinctly expressed in the
terms we are considering, and that solution, that ex-
planation depend on the existence of two variant parties
in the Convent. 111 other wordS, this contemplated
arrangement found its origin in no question of “ peace ''
between Rievaulx and Kirkham, but in a question
of peace within the Priory itself. The Prior and some
of the canons were 011 0116 side, the rest of the canons
and brethren were on the other. These latter were will-
ing to conform to the Cistercian Order, and to become
incorporated in it as members, the canons among them
as monks. The other party, and, as it would seem, with
the Prior at its head, were not so willing.¹

All this seems fairly plain sailing. But may we not
advance a step further, and call in the help of a surmisc
as to what might have been an additional feature of the
case 2 Admitting that there were two parties in the
Convent, and that one of them evidenced a willingness,
or more than a willingness, to J oin the Cistercian Order,

¹ This is a conclusion which appa-
rently commends itself as perfectly
logical, and one that fiows, as of
necessity, from the facts alleged.
And yet it is by no means without its
difficulties. For not only is it known
that at a date some few years subse-
quent to that of the matters now
under notice the Prior’s proclivities
were distinctly towards the Cister-
eian Order, but it is alleged (although
most mistakcnly, as will be evident
in the sequel) that he became not
only a member of the Order, but
even Abbot of Ricvaulx and of Mel-
rose successively. Still there can

be no doubt that, at the probable
date of this convention or agree-
ment, he was still an Augustinian‚
and more than that, that he was
pracffically, in all but the material
endowment and construction of the
Convent, the founder and practical
originator of the Thornton establish-
ment, which also was Augustinian.
Up to 1140, then, we cannot look
upon Prior Waltheof as belonging to
that section of the Kirkham commun-
ity which, it is evident, looked upon
adhesion to the Cistercian Order as
desirable.
