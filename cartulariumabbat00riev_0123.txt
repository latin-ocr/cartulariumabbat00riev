It does not appear to be certain where the “ great chamber‚'’ the
“three romys north thereof‚’' the “parlour‚'' the “entry to the
011111011 chamber,'’ and the “ ohurch ehamber ⁷’ itself, were situate ;
but Mr. Hope seems 10 think that these five entries all refer to the
rooms between 1110 31031 hall and the church. The next entry,
however, touehing the “ abbottes dyning ehamber‚⁷' is characterised
“as 01 great interest, as showing that, at 1110 1351, 1110 Abbot lived
in the farmery. That cottage to the east may be the ‘abbottes
chappell,' although originally the farmery ehapel. The ι011311011

CORRECTION OF A MISTAKE AS TO DATE.

MR. HENRY ORDE-POWLETT has very kindly pointed out to me
that I have been misled‚ 1101 10 seeking to identify William le
Skrop, the grantor 01 1110 01131101 numbered CXLVJ. with the william
10 Serope mentioned in the note, p. 97, but in my 10101001131 (131103
of the deed itself. He writes: “I find Hugo, Rector 01 Brance-
peth‚ granted lands to Henry Scrope, son of William Scrope, in
1308, and mentioned in that connection 10 four different deeds
among the Bolton collection. Hugo de Ask, another 01 1110 wit-
nesses (10 No. (JXLVJ.), as Ι know from another Bolton deed, was
alive in 1293, as also Hasculphus de Cleseby, 111011 Receiver 01 Rich-
mond. Robert de Tyndale‚ also, and William Ruddekyn were
both living at the end of the thirteenth and beginning 01 1110 10111-
10011111 0001111105.” There would therefore be no question as to
the impossibility of identifying Reginald Chubbe (see note 3, p. 95)
with Reginald de Bolton‚ otherwise Reginald Fitlealter, who
must have belonged to an earlier generation.
