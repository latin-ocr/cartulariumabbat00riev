thought before we set ourselves to contemplate the
means at the command of, and the methods, or some of
them, actually adopted by the builders of the Abbey
such as we see it in part, and in part strive to reconstruct
it in thought, and by deduction from what yet remains
to be seen. It was not simply that, as Mr. WValbran
writes (Memorials, 4, n. 2), the “house of Rievaux in
the lifetime of its first Abbot‚ and the celebrated Aelred,
sent out colonies of monks who established the Cister-
cian Abbeys of Melrose in Scotland, and the first of the
Order in that kingdom; Revesby in Lincolnshire 3 and

pose to occupy space unnecessarily
by giving details of matters that are
sufficiently well known already,
instead of inserting remarks of my
own touching on the facts of these
three foundations as emariating from
Rievaulx, I prefer appending the
continuation of Mr. W'albran’s note,
from which the extract in the text
is derived. Of Melrose he proceeds
to say, ‘¹ The former was founded in
1136, by King David 1. (Chron. de
Mailros: Hist. Ang. Script., ed.
Gale); Revesby, in 1142, by william
de Romara, Earl of Lincoln‚ William
his son, and Hawise his wife. ‘ Sciatis

in the Monens-ticon (vol. i. p. 784),
this circumstance took place in the

erroneous; since the confirmation
of the Foundation Charter by King
Stephen (Mon. Ang. ut supra) is
