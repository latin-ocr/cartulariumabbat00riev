1 “A livery,'' says Mr. lVay
(notes to Pr. Pm., p. 3081), “de
noted whatever was dispensed by
the lord to his officials or domestics

different kinds or qualities specified.
Here convent ale and livery ale are
named. In what follows, yeoman
ale—yeoman ale of the great vat—

annually, or at certain seasons3
whether money, victuals‚ or gar-
ments.’' And on the following page,
in his notes on Lyveresone, he adds,
“ corrodium, a lyuerey in an abbaye :
a lyveray of 111616, corrodium. Cath.
Angl. 0οην6άίῑωη, cor-redum, 01· cor-
rodium, implied generally an alimony
or 61101161106, praebenda ‘monachi vel
canonici. —Ducange. . . . The term
Livrere, liueray, occurs in this sense
of a daily pittance of food, Amis and
Amiloun, 1640, 1659 3 in the House-
hold Ordinances the daily allowance
of meat and drink received by each
individual is commonly termed his
livery, and the livery cupboard was
the buffet appointed in apartments
of greater state to receive this provi-
sion at certain times.'' It will be
observed, as we proceed with the
present most interesting series of
extracts, that several kinds of bread

mentioned, while further on rye
loaves and hostall bread are named.
'2 As in the case of the bread, so,
with respect to the ale, we find our-
selves called on to notice the several

Abbot’s ale, and greenhorn or green-
how (for it is written both ways) ale,
besides the ‘ charke ' mentioned in
0116 place, are all enumerated. As an
Essex lad, more than sixty years ago,
I remember the brewhouse attached
to most of the large farmsteads there,
in which, as occasion required, small
beer, harvest beer, ordinary or table
beer, ale, strong ale, were all brewed;
and all these kinds with the ordinary
malt, the quantity used creating the
differences implied. But from memo-
randa touching the‘ ‘assise of ale’'
(and otherwise) it is known that
there were divers kinds of malt em-
ployed in the manufacture of medi-
aev al beer, some being made from oats
and some even from rye. So that
the varieties of ale might be both
numerous and distinct, a mixture of
different kinds of malt being specified
from time to time.

seem that such entries as the present
—for it is by no means a solitary one
—quite fully bear out Mr. Way’s
view that, in the elder days, the
