lii INTRODUCTION.

least, such seems to be the testimony of that which we
are still permitted to behold, and to look upon as the
earliest part of the work which was intended to endure.
Doubtless there was an early choir: a short 0116, almost
certainly, as was the Cistercian use, as well as like so
many other early Norman choirs‚ and perhaps with
apsidal termination. Perhaps the transepts were built
on to that, and the great Norman nave continued, in
its unusual direction, to be raised year after year, section
after section, as at Whitby, until at last the great com-
prehensive plan began to assume a measure of complete—
ness‚ and faireryisions of a gracefuller style began to
dawn on the designers' mental perception.

But we may well pause here for a space. There are

divina officia devotius persolvebant. '³
Then, obtaining the gift of certain
planks and beams, reserved from the
dismantling of (16 Stutevisse’s wooden
castle of Montferat, “plures mona-
sterii aedificatae fuerunt officinae.’'
N ext, the record proceeds ‘⁴ Capella,
de qua superius fiebat mentio, quze
tunc oratorium et dormitorium mona-
chorum exstiterat, nimis arcta erat,
ubi tot monachi et psallerent et pausa-
rent. Abbas ipse Adam et monachi
{edificaverunt magnam illam domum,
ubi nune brasium nostrum conficitur,
de tabulis qnae de ipso castro ligneo
exstiterunt, cu jus partem superiorem
pro oratorio, inferiorem vero pro dor-
mitorio, (liutius habuerunt.’' This
is the sum of. the building processes
during the first ten years. The
second Abbot, between 1160 and
1182, “ opus lapideum incepit in
monasterio, ecclesiam, scilicet, ct
dormitorium monachorum, et quidem
dormitorium et necessaria perfecit : ”
from which it would appear that, up
to 1182, the church itself was only in

an incipient state. Between 1182
and 1197 the frater of stone was
begun and finished, but by extra-
neous assistance. The convent occu-
pied themselves with the calefactory,
and with repairs and rebuildings of
granges and premises, and a new
church was begun, the older build-
ing being inadequate and unseemly.
This commenced chureii, however,
was superseded under the fourth
Abbot, or between 1197 and 1210,
when the ‘⁶ refectorium converso-
rum'' was completed‚ their dorter
commenced3 the cloister in stone
also, and many other of the offices.
And it was not till Palm Sunday in
the year 1207 that the first stone of
the church which was destined to
stand was actually laid. Comment-
ary upon all this in connection with
the slow progress of conventual
building assumed in the text is surely
1166111655. Ι am indebted to Mr. W.
H. st. John Hope for bringing this
parallel to my notice.
