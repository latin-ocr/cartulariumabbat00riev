the editor sayS‚ “ Henry Lord Perey,
who died in 1368, was twice married.
His second wife was Joane, daughter
and sole heir of John, Baron de

daughter, the testatrix, who married
John Lord Roos, and died without
issue at the early age of twenty-seven,
in 1394. Her husband, of precisely
her own age, had died at Paphos in
the island of Cyprus, in the preced-

had both died during similar pilgrim-

Holy Land, but in the Holy Land,
