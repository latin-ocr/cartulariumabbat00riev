G INTRODUCTION.

deed belonging to the Rev. H. O.H01n1es, of Birkby‚ and by
him allowed to be printed in the present volume, No. CCCLVIH.
There is also an entry in Dodswmth, lxiii„ fo. 68, 10 1110 effect
that Abbots Alred of Rievaulx and Roger of Byland were
contemporaries, as also Abbot Silvanus of the former with the
same Abbot of the latter. The entry then proceeds: “Wil-
lelmus Ellerbec, Abbas Rievallis, et Adam de Hustwait, Abbas
Bellandensis‚ eodem tempore.⁷’ Now the only Abbot of
Byland named Adam appears to have been the Abbot who,
according to the list given in Gill's Vallis Eboracensis‚ “had
the King's letters of protection, Sept. 21, 1315.” This entry

then is of interest as giving the personal name of the present
Abbot.

22. JOHN 1.—In Patent Rolls‚ 4 Rich. IL, pt. 2, 111. 20, 18 an
Inspeximus of a Confirmation by Edw. 111„ dated “vicesimo
octavo die Junii, anno regni nostri primo ’⁹ (1327), 111 which
“ J ohannes nunc Abbas” is named. And on this authority the
name of Abbot John is added to the previously existing list.
The document cited is printed below. (See No. 99.)

23. WVILLIAM VL——In the list of Abbots of Rievaux given in
Gill's Vallis Eboraoensis, William (10 Langton stands as the
twenty—second, and with the date 1334 prefixed to his name.
No other information, however, is given. The voluminous and
very interesting confirmation printed below as No. CCCLXX11.‚
and which is derived from the Patent Rolls, 6 Edw. HL, pt. 2,
m. 23, was granted to “ Willelmus nunc Abbas ’' on the 28th
June in that year (1332). Τ1118 was during Archbishop
Melton's time, and his profession is found in that prelate’s
Register at fo. 260, where a note to the following effect occurs:
——At Cawod, nones of Janry‚ 1334-5, the Arclibishop issued
a commission to Henry‚ Bishop of Lincoln, to give the ‘⁶ munus
benedictionis ’' to William de Langton, Abbot elect of Rievaulx.

William (10 Langeton's name is not found in Burton’s Cata-
logne.

24.R10HARD.—The profession of “Ricardus electus Abbas
Monasterii Ryevallensis ’' is seen in Archbishop Zouch’s
Register, fo. chub, in the usual form, with the following Mem.
appended t—-“ Et memor. quod primo die mensis Novembris,
AD. McccxliX., in Capella manerii sui de Cawode, Venerabilis
pater, Willelmus la Zouche, Ebor. Archiepiscopus‚ etc, dictum
Abbatem benedixit, qui quidem Abbas juravit obedientiam 111
forma suprascripta.'' I have met with no other instance in
which Abbot Richard is mentioned.
