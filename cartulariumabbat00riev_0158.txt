1 The place designated Locum-
slehit in the last document but one.

2 Before the clause beginning at
this place there is a sentence intro<
duced in the corresponding part of
No. Lx. (which is, in reality, and to
a great extent, only a repetition of
the present deed) that supplies an
evident defeet, and probably indi-
cates an omission in the document
now under notice. That sentence
is “ Ex orientali parte de WVellebrune
est divisa sicut Redover descendit
de Blawad, unde oritur ab orientali
parte de Midelhovet, usque ad Halle-
wat3 et a Blawat usque ad divisas
de Cliveland.'' Of the names here
mentioned Blawad and Midelhovecl
admit of easy recognition, and Red-
over also by implication. Blawad
is the Bloworth of the Ordnance
Survey, and Middle Head has been
already noticed. Redover (or Red-
ofra‚ as it stands in other places), as
a continuation of Blawath, can only
be the stream now designated the
Hodge Beck, while Hallewat is, so
far, unrecoguisable.

3 No name like this has any exist-
ence in the vicinity required by the
description.

4 Muscotes or Muscoates now.
Muscotes Grange remains to attest
the fact that the Abbey used to hold
and to work the land there. The
site is not far from the confluence of
the Riccal with the Rye.

⁵ This name is gone, having passed

into oblivion as the thing it desig-
nated fell into disuse. The “Stud-
farm’⁷ of modern days affords but
little to remind one of the days
when the mares and their offspring
roamed practically wild, and had to
be driven into the scalda or fold year
by year, in order that the animals
old enough for work might be cap—
tured and withdrawn.

⁶ It is reasonable to suppose that
North Holm indicates the neighbour-
hood of this place.

7 Uncertain.

8 This place is recognisable under
the modern corruption of Bowforth.
It is found less than a mile some—
what east of south of Welburn.

⁹ ColdDike, as itis spelt in the map,
lies about a mile south of Edston.

10 This is, in all particulars, a
noteworthy name. According to
reason and anangy, the meaning
ought to be “the gate or roadway
of the Welsh (or foreign) carls or
men 3 ’' and it would be easy to in-
dulge in divers speculations as to
how it came to be so designated. It
may be more to the point to collate
with it the name Wainearlegate from
the Guisborough Chartulary (which
probably means the road taken by
the carls in charge of wains) and to
avoid all further guesses.

¹¹ This name is found in a later
document under the form—probably
corrupt—of Jaistemwad. No re-
minder of the name seems to exist.
