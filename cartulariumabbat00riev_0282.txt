156 CARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.
et bladis meis et hominum meorum, ex parte aquilonali, a
Grraigretknottesl usque ad divisas Episcopi Dunelm., et inde
versus occidentem quantum foresta mea durat versus Westmere-
land, ita quod pulli et pultrae, quando fuerint duorum annorum,
inde removebuntur. Et praeter haeo dedi eis pasturam in una
parte ejusdem forestae ad sexies XX animalia sine secta, et ad
xii vaccas et duos tauros, cum nutrimento suo, ad opus pastorum
suorum infra Egleshope2 et Hodeshope, per has [142] divi-
sas :—Ex parte aquilonali de Mideltona a capite de Snelesgile 3
super Langeschaghe 4 usque ad leelaikeburne, et a leelaike-
burne per transversum Egleshope usque ad Graigetknottes,
et sicut divisae sunt inter me 61 Episcopum Dunelm. superius
versus aquilonem, quantum foresta mea durat. Item ex parte
meridiana a capite Snelesgile per Gaitecastel us[que] ad rivum
de Hodeshope, per filum aquae superius versus aquilonem
usque ad divisas forestae praedicti Episcopi, quantum foresta
mea durat, ita quod vituli et vitulae ipsarum vaccaruni, quando
fuerint duorum annorum, inde remo[ve]buntur. Quare Vaccae,
cum tauris suis, 61 nutrimento suo, libere pascentur in com-
muni pastura de Mideltona ubicunque pecora ejusdem villae
pascuntur, quando pastores eorum voluerint. Et in eadem

hope, nearly as certainly, that of the
latter. As regards the clement laike,
it may be observed that it occurs
in other local names in the same

provincial word for a rounded rocky
summit, and the name may be so
explained.

2 This name is found still in exist-

vicinity, aud so there is little doubt
that it has some special significance.
I have met with the term cocklaik or
cocklake in the same sense as cockshut
01· cockshoot (see Yarrell's British
Binis, ii. 588) or cock-road3 the
meaning being the route or line of
flight taken by the woodcock in its
passage to its feeding ground in the
evening3 and ulflails, as meaning a
place frequented by wolves, suggests
a by no means impossible explana-
tion of the name before us, See
notes and below. But, on the
other hand, it is necessary to advert
to the fact that in No. cxvr., of
which the present deed is, in many
respects, a reproduction, the name
is spelt NVlfuelaickeburnQ and that
is WVolf-weH-oak-burn, and in all
probability this is the preferable
reading.

1 This is written Gragretenottes
in No. CXV1., which is sufficient to
show that the earlier form in the
present deed, or Graigetknottes‚ is
misspelt. Knot is a northern

enee some six miles north-west of
Barnard Castle, and a mile or so
distant from the Tees. And there
is another hope in the same vicinity,
but further to the north, which may,
quite possibly, as being in close
proximity to a stretch of moorland
named “Monkmoor,’' supply the
habitation of Hodeshope.

³ Snaisgill is a local name found
in the same neighbourhood, and,
whether the corruption exhibited in
that form be due to the country folk
or the nomenclators of the Ordnance
Survey, there is no reasonable doubt
that it represents the name Sneles—
gile. It is worthy of passing note
that the same prefix is not an un-
known one in the formation of local
names. Thus there was a mediaeval
Snelesgriff in the parish of Guis—
borough, not to mention others.

⁴ Langeshage in No. CXVI. This
is simply Langshaw in our present
speech. All these names occur in
the vieinity of Middleton in Tees—
