bishop Romanus (Reg. fo. xxxb). This date must of necessity
be Feb. 2d in 1287 3 for the Archbishop was consecrated at
Rome on the lOth of February in 1286, and thus he could
scarcely have been at Wilton on the 2d, and at Rome on the
loth, allowing for all the difficulties of so long a Journey. But
there is no doubt that Thomas had become Abbot in, or
probably before, 12863 for, among the “Pedes finium. Ebor.‚
13-26 Edw. I.'' is one dated “in crastino Ascensionis Domini
14 Edw. 1.‚'’ between Abbot Thomas of Rievaulx and William
de la Hay, acting on behalf of his wife, in re certain lands in
Little Busby, etc.; and, inasmuch as this Fine has been acci-
dentally omitted in the Appendix, 1 subj0in the following very

name is found mentioned as Abbot in September 1291.

17. HENRY IL—This Abbot's name does not appear in
Burton's list, or in any other with which I am acquainted.
Still, there seems to be sufficient reason for inserting it in
the present list. The authority depended on is au extract
from the Clairvaux Chartulary given by Longstaffe in the
Appendix to his “Darlington,’' pp. lxi, lxii, which runs as
follows z-—“ 6 Κ61. Apr. 1301. Henry, Abbot, and the Convent
of Ryevall, 111 public Chapter, . . . established three monks of
their House to celebrate three masses for ever for the health and
prosperity of life of their beloved in Christ, Master Simon de
Clervaux, Rector of Lith, from that date, at three altars in their
church‚ viz„ at the altar os: S. Matthew, where a mass of the
Blessed Virgin is celebrated3 at the altar of S. Martin the
Bishop, where one for all the faithful departed is celebrated
daily3 and at the altar of the Blessed Thomas the Martyr, a
mass; so that the three monks at the three altars, while
Master Simon lived, should say 6 collect for his special 11661111,
