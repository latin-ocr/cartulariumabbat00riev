1 There can be no hesitation in
filling in the required letters of this
name, for no other Abbot is recorded
having the same initial ; and this
necessarily leads on to the identifi-
cation of the Abbot who is mentioned
in immediate sequence to Abbot Syl-
vanus. There is no doubt that Syl-
vanus was Abbot before the middle of
1181, although in the list of Abbots as
given by Burton, Bernard, the Abbot
next before him, is said to “occur”
in 1180: for he is specially named
in No. ccum, which is a Bull of Pro-
tection by Pope Alexander 111., ad-
dressed to Archbishop Roger of
Bishopsbridge, and Bishop Hugh
Pudsey ε and Alexander died in Au-
gust 1181. The probability of course
is that the date of the Privilegium
in question is not to be driven down
into the weeks or months immedi-
ately preceding the death of the
Pontiff named.

‘⁶‘ The conclusion at the end of the
last note is corroborated by the fact
that Robert de Pipewell, the Abbot
of Fountains who is mentioned here
—for there is no other to satisfy the
conditions imposed by the tet-ms of
the document before us—-died “ Anno
Domini 1179, quinto Idus J anuarii’'
(Memorials of Fountains Abbey, i.
p. 132). ThiS‚ it hardly need be
said, throws back the accession of
Abbot Sylvanus a year or two further.

³ It is left to inference to decide

what granges these, belonging to
Fountains and Rievaulx respectively,
actually were. But the inference,
under the circumstances specified, is
not one difficult to draw. In the
first place, the granges of the two
houses are adjacent to each other3
and in the second, they are not far
from the sea—“ versus mare.'' The
only possessions of Rievaulx in Cleve-
land answering to this description
were those at Normanby (see above,
Nos. CXVI. -cxnm, and the cor-
responding property of Fountains
was at Eston, of which parish Nor-
manby is a township. Under the
head of Estun, Burton says, “Ste-
phen, son of Robert de Mainel, gave,
about A.D. 1:230, all his sand here
(sabulum) belonging to this town, as
far as the land where the sea ascends,
as far as the Tees, to make fisheries
thereon ; also two acres of land,” etc.
The date affixed to this grant is the
only difficulty in our way, and that
is removed if we bear in mind that
there were two Stephens de Menil,
each son of Robert, and that the
former of these may have been the
original donor, and the second have
confirmed previous gifts of his an-
cestor, as it is matter of fact that he
did as to previous grants to Guis-
borough, in the very place under
mention. Indeed, with the present
document to fall back upon, it seems

dliffictllt to arrive at any other con-
c usion.
