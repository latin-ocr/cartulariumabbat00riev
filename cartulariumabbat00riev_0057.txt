constructions'.2 I can liken them to nothing so sug-
gestingly as to the sheds and cabins “run up '' for the
workmen's occupatiori and use in the near vicinity of
some great structure or engineering effort, which, it is
known, will occupy architect ancl builder for months,
perhaps years, before the last sound of the workman's
tool can be heard.

And so it was beyond reasonable doubt with those
whose lot it was to initiate the great work at Rievaulx.
They must have laboured at first, not so much with the
expectation‚ or the hope even, as the intention that
what they were doing should be hut for a time, should
be swept away to make room for, at least to be super-
seded hy, something better, higher, worthier. And in
reality that something nobler and worthier could scarcely

have been begun until some sensible space later.1 At

when these sentences in the text
were written, uulooked for, illustra-
tion if not confirmation of the views
embodied in them, let me adduce
the two following extracts from the
Chronica de Mailros : — ‘⁵ Anno
mcxxxv1.: faeta est Abbatia S.
Mariae de Mailros, feria secunda
Paschae, et Ricardus primus Abbas
Melros.” The second, on the fol-
lowing page, is “Anno MCXLVI:
Ecclesia S. Maria: de Mailros dedi-
cata est, v kalendas Augusti, in die
Dominica.⁷’ Here, then, an interval
of ten years and a half intervenes
between the constitution of the
Abbey founded hythe first of the
colonies sent out from the parent
house of Rievaulx, and the formal
setting apart of their first ehurch for
the purposes for which it had been
erected. From every point of view

the circumstance is noteworthy‚ and
the question of a temporary or make-
shift place in which to worship in
the interim, is one which answers
itself the moment it is raised. But
a further and still more practica]
illustration of the same matter is
found in the notices given in the
Chronica de Melsa of the initiatory
steps taken in the establishment of
that Convent in the selected place.
The entries in their unadorned sim·
plicity and directness are as follows.
Under date 1150 to 1160, Adam, the
first Abbot, “fecit aedificari quan-
dam magnam domum, licet ex vili
cemate [?wicker or wattled work]

taret. Fecit etiam quandam capellam
juxta domum praedictam . . . ubi
