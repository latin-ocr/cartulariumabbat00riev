¹ I am indebted in no small degree the point. But it transpired that

to the observation and practical
knowledge of Mr. Henry Rye, late
clerk of the works on the Duncombe
Park estate, for this mutual explana-
tion of the chartei-s 1157 1116 561(1
features referred to, and the features
by the charters, to 6 far fuller and
more conclusive degree than other-
wise could have been looked for. I
was greatly perplexed with the con-
ditions and circumstances involved
in the decds, and sent written
inquiries for local information, if
attainable, as to “guteria‚” “insula‚”
ete. Unable myself to give any
definite idea of what was 11166111 1157
“guteria,'' and. having no definite
idea of any “insula'' beyond what
might have been in the possibly less
restricted river-bed of seven hundred
years ago, my inquiries secmed to
elicit nothing really helpful, or to

Mr. Rye had formed definite views

positions, from which the two kinds
of building-stone already noticed
were obtained, and, besides that, of
the mode by which the said stone,
in either case, had been conveyed to
the actual site of the abbey. He
was convinced that the stone had
been conveyed by water, and that
the deep wide ditch or dike referred
to had been the bed of a canal suffi-
cient for the purpose. On finding
inyself shortly afterwards enabled
to arrange a personal visit to the
locality, I traversed the whole length
of the inferred canal, and found it
carried as close to the foot of the
hill as it possibly could be, the
requisite water-level having been
obtained by the construction of 6
