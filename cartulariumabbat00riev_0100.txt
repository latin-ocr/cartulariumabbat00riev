how long there is nothing to show—he continued to be Prior
there. But inasmuch as Abbot William did not die until
August 1145, and Ailred or Etheldred was Abbot before De-
cember 1147, it is obvious that WValtheof's occupancy of the
abbatial chair, if he ever did occupy it, must have been of the
briefest character. For it seems hardly possible to throw over
entirely the statement of the Melrose Chronicler given above
as to the fact that Maurice was Abbot for at least some short
time, in succession to William. And, even so, we would have
to ignore the equally precise statement of the same authority
as to the immediate succession of Aelred to Maurice. But
whether we admit or reJect the allegation that Waltheof, late
Prior of Kirkham, was for a time, however short, Abbot of
Rievaulx, it is hardly possible to be blind to the possible illus-
tration herein found, of that remarkable phrase in the cyro—
graph between Kirkham and Rievaulx, on which comment has
been made at a previous page (pp. xxvi, xxvii) : “ Hoc quoque
:sciendum est quod nec a loco nostro voluimus discedere, nec
Priorem nostrum amittere, donec ea quae inter nos constituta sunt
ad debitum finem producta fuerint,’' to say nothing of the final
clause of the same document, which stipulates that the seced-
ing Kirkham canons and brethren should have the same stand-
ing in the Chapter and Order of Cisteaux as any monk of the
said Order. If the approximate date assigned to this cyro-
graph be correct (see above, pp. xxiv, xxv), it was too early by
four or five years at least to think of losing their Prior in con-
sequence of his ‘⁶ secession '’ to become Abbot of RievauIX.

Dunelm„ Preface, p. lx, he is specially named in a deed dated
1 Kal. December, 1147, as, together with Robert, Abbot of
Newminster, acting as assessor to Bishop William de St. Bar-
bara3 and again, in another document, assigned to about the
same date by the Editor, he is again expressly named in asso—
ciation with Abbot Robert of N ewminster, and Priors Cuthbert

died in 1167 (Clw’on. dc stlailros, p. Sl), his obit being observed
in the church of Dur-ham on January sth (Liber Vitae, p. 141).
We learn from Reginald that Aelred was at Kirkcudbright in
1164 (p. 178), and there seems to be no reason to question the
