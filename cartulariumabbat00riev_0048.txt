Oonstrained as I have felt myself by the circum-
stances of the case to speak with the caution or reserve
qualifying the preceding paragraph, it is not without
diffidence that I proceed to offer the following facts and

J have
noticed in a brief note on page 16 that throughout the

considerations for a measure of attention.

Museum Ms. Cartularium the Founder's name is invari-
ably written Espec, and without the prefixed L3 and
I might have added that the same rule prevails in all
the authentic early writings in which he is named. As
to precisely when the form L'Espec was introduced, or
why, I am not in a position to make any assertion ; but
my impression is that the earliest instance of what I
look upon as an innovation on the old mode of spelling
the name is certainly later by more than a century,
perhaps much more than a century, than the date of
the foundation of Rievaulx Abbey. The original form
is certainly Espec and not L'Espec. Now, here let me
draw attention to the circumstance that King Stephen
in 1135, in the presence of Walter Espec himself,
Geoffrey de Trailli, and all Walter's other nephews
still living, confirms Espec's foundation grant to

VVardon Abbey in the following terms1—“Scitote me

accessions were made, in many and
striking instances, at the expense of

towards the end of the Conqueror's
reign, and recorded, not in its proper

place, but altogether at the end in
the Yorkshire part of the Domesday
Book, almost all the constituents
therein were withdrawn from the
Terra Regis of the earlier pages of
the same volu1ne; and that again
when very large accessions to the
original grant were made by King
Henry, and, it is likely, within the
first decade of his reign, the said

the Earl of Mortain’s fee, and some
two or three others which were iu
the same predicament with it, viz„
forfeited by reason of the revolt of
their late owners. And in the same
two ways, but especially the latter,
a great part of lValter Espec's
Yorkshire estates would seem to
have been made up.
