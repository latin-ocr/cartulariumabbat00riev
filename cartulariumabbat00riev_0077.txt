INTRODUCTION.

The grant was not altogether gratuitous on the part
of Hugh Malbis, as will be observed on inspection of
No. LXXV„ the phrase being “ut autem hanc elemosinam
libentius facerem dederunt mihi monachi XX s. pro cari-

It was “elemosina‚'' but elemosina for which a

consideration had to be given.

in the direction in which Ι was quite
aware the Hangendebridge must be
looked for. But of course a dam of
the character in question, sufficiently
high and strong to head back the
water of Rye, so that it might
actually fiow back to the foot of
Rievaulx sitessand hence the neces-
sity for that which was contemplated
in the phrase “quam propius montem
potuerunt''—could not be made
effectual for its intended purpose if
any low, weak, or broken places
presented themselves in either bank
between the dam and the building—
site. And it is hardly necessary to
observe that, while the monks could
do what was necessary ¹in the way
of embankment, 01· what not, on
their own side, on the other they
were powerless, apart from the
special permission of the possessor,
and the privilege accorded by him
of raising the necessary embank-
ments, wherever needed, on his side
also. And hence originated the
being as well as the occasion for the
aforesaid encroachments, each of
which can have been nothing else
originally than the site of an em-
bankment designed to keep the
water of the river from escaping
there, and so defeating the very end
and object of the dam, besides over-
flowing and wasting all the low-
lying or holmland adjacent. But
even this is not all. In the course
of the second day of these investiga-
tions Mr. Rye remarked‚ as the
party was passing a given point, and

ὰ propos of a piece of river-side
meadow-land—“This field is still
named The Island.’' The meaning
and the application of the name was
now a matter of easy deduction.
XVhen the canal, wide enough and
deep enough to permit the passage
of stone-laden lighters or barges,
had been in existence, all the low-
lying or river-side land between the
Rye and the “guteria⁷' had been
practically an island3 and as I had
already seen in the course of the
earlier part of the morning, when I
had had the opportunity—lasting
only about half an hour, unluckily—
of looking at some of the earlier
entries in an old survey of the Dun-
combe Park estate, a very consider-
able number οἱ what were designated
‘⁶ beast-gates ”were then—a century
and half before, at least‚—lotted out
in “ the Island.'' Ι would only add
further here, that this “guteria”
or canal was that which was de-
signed and constructed in connec-
tion with the transport of the stone
which was used in the second or
later building epoch of the two under
comment. The quarry worked for
the stone in question had become
available to the monks in virtue of
the grant printed as No. LXXIV„
and the expansion of that end of the
“guteria,’' amounting in reality to
a kind of basin for the reception of
the flats or lighters employed in the
transport, is still perfectly and easily
traceable.
