CARTULARIUM RIEVALLENSE.

Isti omnes, ut diximus, juraverunt, et nos cum ipsis, proprium
esse wastum Regis ab Alvestainbech,1 usque ad Tacrivelingam,2

1 The boundary here given is one
the general run of which is per-
haps, on the whole, fairly easy to
make out. And yet on trying to
make out its details it is found to be
beset with manifold difficulties and
perplexities. It is impossible to
give the questions involved adequate
consideration 111 the present series of
notes· , but an attempt will be made
to deal with them in a manner more
or less adequate in the Introduction.
Of that part of the entire boundary
involved by the stream to the name
of which this note is appended, it
may at least be said that it is alto-
gether clear and unmistakable.

2 Not the slightest trace of this
name has rewarded the search made
for it. And unfortunately there
are other names similarly involved,
as to which the same sort of remark,
however qualified in some one par-
ticular or more, has necessarily to be
made. One remark, however, it
seems requisite to make in connection
with Tacriueling—assuming that to
be the correct reading of the name :
it might be Tacrineling—and that is
that Allerston Beck and Tacriueling
are clearly intended to represent or
denote the eastern and western
limits of the grant or grants involved.
This will stand out more evidently
if we refer to the document contain—
ing the fullest delineation of the
boundary under notice, and that is
No. CCX„ or Henry the Second's
Charter of Confirmation, which, so
to speak, consolidates the mass of
charters which go to the completion
of the grant of the “Vastum subtus
Pickeringam.” The document re-
ferred to, after noticing that the
metoe et divisa concerned had been
formally sworn to by the KVapent ake
of Pickeiing- Lith‚ goes on to specify
as follows. — “5011., ( luicquid est in-
ter Alvestainebech et Tacriueling 1n
longitudine, praeter pr atum de Eduie-
merse——per has, scil., divisas: a loco
ubi Alvestainebech cadit in Derewent-
am, sicut eadem Derewenta currit
usque ad locum ubi Ria cadit in
Derewentam ; et inde ubi Costa
cadit 111 Riam ; et inde per Costham

ad Taciiueling, et inde per Tacriue-
ling usque ad fossatum monachorum,
et inde per idem fossatum sicut currit
Lund et cadit m Costham3 et inde
per Costham contra aquilonem sur-
sum usque ad locum ubi Kiptofte-
sich cadit in costam, et inde sicut
Kiptoftesich tendit usque ad Mid-
sich, et inde per Midsich usque
ubi Thorntonebech cadit in Midsich;
et inde per Thornetonebech, con-
tra aquilonem, 05006 ad fossatum
quod circuit campum de Theoke-
marais, et inde peridem fossatum
usque ad Blastam3 et inde per
sikettum quod ibi est, in Midsich,
et inde ut Midsich descendit 111
Alvestainebech, et inde sicut Al-
vestainebech descendit in Derewen—
tam.’' Now, it is to be observed
that the boundary is coincident with
the Costa from its confluence with
the Rye as far as Tacriueling, and
that then it deviates from the water-
line hitherto followed, and threads
Tacriueling itself (whether it be a
thread of water, or a longitudinal
depression of the land, or an arti-
ficial bank), until it arrives at a dike
made by the monks themselves,
following that dike alongside the
Lund until the Costa is once inore
reached. The question of course is,
“ On which side of the Costa is this
digression made? '' The most pro-
bable answer seems to be, “ On the
west side ⁷'; and that it is quite
within the range of probability that
Tacriueling was near what is now
called Tranmere Hill, and that what
is now Ackland Beck represents the
ancient Lund ; and perhaps this last
suggestion is not robbed of any pro-
bability by the circumstance that its
course is very circuitous, and that
“ sicut circuit Lund ” is the reading,
instead of “sicut currit Lund,’' in
the Patent Rolls copy of King Rich-
ard’s Confirmation which we have in
cnxxr1.; and this, besides the fact
that the Ackland Beck takes its
course through what is marked on
the map as ‘⁸ Lund Forest.⁷’ But,
however this may be, the boundary,
after having rejoined the Costa, pro-
ceeds northwards along the line of the
