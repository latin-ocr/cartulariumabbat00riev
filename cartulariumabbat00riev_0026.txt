precise in quoting the whole passage that we may be
the better enabled to compare it with the countervail-

of above as the second and final Endowment Charter.
What wc find there is as is here given: “Sciatis nos
concessisse et dedisse . . . totum manerium de Kirk-
ham, in bosco et plano, in terris et aquis, in pratis et
pascuis, in piscinis et molendinis, et omnibus eidem

called for—of these extracts from these two charters
is aboundingly sufficient to show not only that one of
them is later than the other, but that, as regards Kirk-

one. But we may go a step further yet. The first of
the two charters dates itself, as we have seen, subse-
quently to 1131, perhaps even after 11333 but the
second, as addressed to Archbishop Thurstan and Bishop
Geoffrey of Durham‚ who were contemporaries in their
several dignities only from 1133 to 1140, must take
date within that interval of six or seven years, and
probably towards the latter limit of it.

the first place, we note the full grant of the Kirkham
