CCXXXV. CXC. Omnibus fidelibus et S. Ecclesiae filiis,
Wallevus,⁵ Prior, et Capitulum Ecclesiae Kirkehamensis, in

l} Henricus. He reigned from 1100
ti 1135.

² Archbishop from 1119 to 1139-40.

³ There is a copy of this document
in Dodsworth, vol. ix. f. 162b, in
which the initial employed to desig-
nate this personage is D. In the
Museum Cartularium it appears to
be O. In the list of Priors given by
Burton, Drogo stands third, and the
dates annexed are 1195 and 1199.
This, of course, is very much too late
for the present deed, which cannot
be sensibly later than the Founda-
tion of Rievaulx, and most likely
was contemporaneous therewith.
But it is further to be noticed that be-
tween Burton’s first Prior, William,
Walter Espec’s uncle, and the second
Prior, also William, is an interval
sufficient to allow for, or even to
sifigtglpst, the apcegsion to and vacatior}
o e rlora e even a series o
Priors. p KVilliamyof Garton became
Prior in 1122; the next william is
heard of in 1190. Ι prefer, there-
fore, to let the apparent Ο of the
Cartularium stand.

⁴ Beneficientia, but the last five

letters dotted under as erroneous,
and α substituted above.

⁵ See Note 3 to last deed. This
document, therefore, gives the name
of one of the possible “series'’ of
Priors of Kirkham intervening be-
tween the first, or william of Garton,
and the William mentioned next
after him in Burton’s list. In Dods-
worth's copy of the present docu-
ment “ Walt.'’ is written in place of
V'allevus, but the latter name is per·
fectly plain in the Cartularium itself.
Assuming, as we may not unreason-
ably do, from the sequence of the
two deeds, that the Prior with the
initia] O. (or D. according to Dods-
worth) preceded the Prior lVallevus
of the present deed, we shall have a
date probably approximating the
close of Henry's reign, or about 1130
to 1134, for the former, and for the
latter, in the period not remotely
subsequent. And next to lVallevus
(VValdevus, Waltheof) will, it may
be presumed, come Galfridus, or
Gaustidus, who was a contempo-

rary of Ailred, Abbot of Rievaulx,
