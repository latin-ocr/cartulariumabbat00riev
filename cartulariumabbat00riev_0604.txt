These documents are highly illustrative of the social life
and position of the farmers and labourers in the county of
Durham at a very early period, and throw a fiood of light
upon the ancient village communities with which they were
associated.

The volumes in progress, as will be seen from the list,
are not inferior to their predecessors either in novelty or
value. The Secretary has also been engaged for more than
thirty years on the preparation of a Glossary of Northern
Words, from the earliest times to the beginning of the
eighteenth century. His object was, primarily, to present
to the Members of the Society an explanatory catalogue of
the ancient English words which occur in our publicatione,
but this design has been extended so as to include all other
Northern words of a like character which have occurred to
him in the course of his reading, chiefly among unpublished
materials. It is proposed to issue, tentatively, the words
under the letter A, to seek the opinion of the Members of
the Society, and, if possible, to secure their assistance. Mr.
Lawley has already rendered most kind and valuable help,
and others, no doubt, will follow his example. The work
will be a word-list, giving the meanings where they can be
ascertaffled, without enter-ing upon the knotty question of
derivatione. That may safely be left to Dr. J. H. Murray
and his learned associates, to whom the publication of such
a work as the present would be a most welcome boon.
